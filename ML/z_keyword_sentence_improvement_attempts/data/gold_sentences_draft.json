            " Indeed, we could relate the most notable differences between recent ozone profietrend studies to instrumental drift (WMO, 2014; Harris et al 2015)  This led us to a conservatieestimate of the decadal stability of several megd records, which, until more rigourous analyses are performed, provie essential information for the recent trend assessments by WMO and SI2N  Covering most limb and occultation ozone profies of the past three decades, thegound-based networks of sonde and lidar instruments, and all major data quality indicators, this assessment is arguably the most comprehensieoundbased analysis so far  Whiebias and short-term variability of satellierecords are well documented in the lieature, this is much less the case for their long-term stability, the impact of auxiliary data and their mutual consistency  We therefore believe that this work will contribute to an improved interpretation of observation-based studies of the long-term evolution of ozone and its link to climate change  However, our results represent a snapshot of the current versions of the data sets  In the near future, improved (and for some instruments longer) ozone profietieseries will be released by the satellieteams and by thegound-based observers  Their efforts may lead to more stable records, which, in turn, would increase the sensitivity to even smaller drifts  In addition, the inclusion of microwave radiometer measurements and model data should help to evaluate the stability in the mesosphere and improve current estimates in the UTLS, especially in the tropics  10 The satellieozone profieLevel-2 data used in this work were obtaie from: - SAGE II v7 (available at: , see also Damadeo et al 2013), - SAGE III v4 (available at: , see also Thomason et al 2010), - HALOE v19 (available at: , see also Nazaryan et al 2005), - UARS MLS v5 (available at: , see also Lieey et al 2003), - Aura MLS v3 (available at: , see also Lieey et al 2013b), - POAM II v6 (available at: , see also Lumpe et al 1997), - POAM III v4 (available at: , see also Lumpe et al 2002), - OSIRIS v5 (available at: , see also Degenstein et al 2009), - SMR 501GHz v2 (available at: , see also Urban et al 2005), - GOMOS IPF 6 (available at: , see also Kyrl et al 2010), - MIPAS ML2PP 6 (available at: , see also Raspollinie al 2013), - SCIAMACHY SGP 5 (available at: , see also Lichtenbeg 2011), - ACE-FTS v3 (available at: , see also Boone et al 2013) and - MAESTRO v1 (available at: , see also McElroy et al 2007)  Thegound-based ozonesonde and stratospheric ozone lidar measurements were downloaded from the NDACC Data Host Facility (), the WOUDC data archie() and the SHADOZ data archie(, see also Thompson et al 2012)"

            " Taking all of these dynamical and chemical processes into account, it is fair to presume that March reservoir anomalies are largely dictated by the stregh of the BDC in the immediately prior winter months, with perhaps some additional amount of variability due to loss of ozone to the troposphere due to STT of ozone during the concurrent winter season and longer tiecale anomaly residuals left in the system from the previous year (eg Fioletov & Shepherd, 2003; Tegtmeier et al 2010; Weber et al 2011; Zhang et al 2017)  Gie that the interannual variability of the BDC is reasonably well simulated in modern reanalyses (Abalos et al 2015), then collectiey, the above lieof reasoning suggests that reanalyses should be adequate for measuring interannual March ozone reservoir anomalies  To help verify this supposition, we have compared ozone reservoir calculations for Aura MLS to the same calculations using ERA-Interim and MERRA-2 (Figure A1)  Aura MLS ozone is assimilated into ERA-Interim in 2008, the second half of 2009, and 2010-2015, whieit is assimilated into MERRA-2 for 2005-2015  ERA-Interim therefore provie a somewhat independent estimate of the richness of the spring ozone reservoir for 4 of the 11 MLS years  We use MLS version 4 data (Lieey et al 2017), which has 2-3 km resolution in the UTLS  The MLS data are prepared by taking cosiesquare wegted, 24 h averages around each gridpoint, and then averaging each day's gridded data over the month  The data are then interpolated onto ietropic surfaces using MERRA-2 temperatures  Comparing March mean ozone on the 350 K ietrope for ERA-Interim (Figures A1a and A1b), MLS (Figures A1c and A1d), and MERRA-2 (Figures A1e and A1f ) reveals that all three data sets exhibit low ozone abundances in 2009 and high abundances in 2011  These 2 years were chosen because they demonstrate two key features (one dynamical and one chemical) related to the stregh of the spring reservoir that both reanalyses were able to reproduce  First, winters with persistently negatieNAM states (ie weak vortex states) are typically associated with rich spring ozone reservoirs and consequently large STT of ozone in the ensuing late spring and summer months (section 3; see also Kiesewetter et al 2010)  However, whiethe winter of 2009 was punctuated by one of the strongest negatieNAM events on record (Martieu & Son, 2010), all three data sets indicate that the spring reservoir was ozone poor"

            " deficiencies are caused by two major factors: deep convection decays at too low an altitude in the UT, and the source of CO from isoprene in the model is too large in the wet season  Thegeater lag in GEOS-5 is in part because convection decays at a lower altitude, and in part because convection moves southward later than in GEOS-4  The CO peak from biomass burning at 147 hPa persists longer than the observed MLS peak, resulting from the dominant influence of slow large scale ascent in transporting this highly seasonal source in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL)  Our evaluation of the CO simulations implies that isoprene emissions from South America in MEGAN v2 as drie by the GEOS meteorological fields are too high for much of the year  The TES data shows a localie overestimate in model CO over western South America that is present from August to April, somewhat to the south of thegographic peak in isoprene emissions (Figs  3 and 4)  The overestimate is smallest, or missing, in May-July (not shown), when the isoprene emissions from South America in the model are smallest  Barkley et al (2008) concluded from an analysis of satelliedata for formaldehyde (HCHO), a degradation product of isoprene oxidation, that isoprene emissions are very low in May-July  The MLS data also provieconvincing eviece that the isoprene emissions in the model are too high, as they are responsible for the local maximum in CO at 215 hPa over South America from November to March that is present in the model simulations but not in the observations (Figs  5 and 6)  The isoprene source of CO also causes the lag of the CO seasonal maximum in the model UT compared to that in the MLS data as shown by the tagged CO results (Fig"

            ") Another potential problem for daily maps comes from the NCEP assimilated data (not an actual data measurement) which has several different definitions of tropopause pressure and contributes to additional errors in tropospheric ozone  For MLS, the current v1 retrievals have difficulty in accurately measuring ozone beyond 215 hPa; it is anticipated that the next MLS version will improve this condition  In addition, MLS measurements are along-track only and a method must be established to fill in data between orbital gaps to establish daily SCO maps  This study utilie a 2-D interpolation scheme to fill in missing MLS data  This study has also examie other methods including assimilation of MLS ozone (I  Stajner, personal communication, 2006)  Another method is reverse domain filling (RDF) (M  Schoeberl, personal communication, 2006)  These latter methods depend critically on the accuracy of wind fields and the vertical resolution and accuracy of the ozone profiemeasurements  All of these issues for improving the daily tropospheric ozone maps from OMI and MLS are being investigated as work in progress  Summary  One year (September 2004 to August 2005) of daily tropospheric ozone derie from Aura OMI and MLS measurements were evaluated for spatial and temporal variations and compared with the Global Modeling Initiaties COMBO CTM  OMI and MLS ozone retrievals indicate no substantial calibration differences for measuring tropospheric ozone as inferred from comparisons with both OMI CCD measurements of SCO and ozonesondes (WOUDC and SHADOZ) extending from the tropics to high latitudes"
