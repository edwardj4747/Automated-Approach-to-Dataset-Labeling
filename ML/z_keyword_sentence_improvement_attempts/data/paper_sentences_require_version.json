            " the estimates of the errors are found by perturbing the inputs to the inversion, using the following uncertainties",
            " the uncertainty in the lieposition is ignored because the frequency grid used in the inversion is shifted to centre a measurement",
            " sheese et al (2017) use versions 3 and 3 mls co data, which show good agreement with v4 (lieey et al 2018), and have not included data from the summer months when co concentrations are very low",

            " the instrument makes use of a highfrequency lna, before the down-conversion of the atmospheric signal, to achieve high snrs at tieresolutions on the order of an hour or less",
            " error estimates show that the uncertainty in the t input for the inversions and the statistical noieon the spectrum are the largest contributions to the error budget, giving a maximum in the error profieof 12 % of the a priori profie the mean of the averaging kernel matrix for the coram dataset gie an average retrieval altitude range of 47-87 km, with an average altitude resolution of 12 to 28 km over this range",
