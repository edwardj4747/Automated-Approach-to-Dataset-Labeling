Investigation using spatiotemporal analysis and trend is critical to understand the warm and cold phases of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which are El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. In this work, the spatial distribution of temperature, precipitation and evaporation over the Pacific Ocean is investigated during the two different El Ni\u00f1o (2014\u20132016) and La Ni\u00f1a (2016\u20132017). Three different data sources were included in this study: temperature from a remote satellite sensor (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer [MODIS]), precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite space mission and evaporation from NASA\u2019s numerical climate model, the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). This work reveals how El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events impact the water cycle components.",

To estimate them, geodetic observations are widely employed and compared to geophysical models. In this research, we focus on the Earth\u2019s crust deformations resulting from hydrology mass changes, as observed by GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) gravity mission and modeled using WGHM (WaterGAP Global Hydrological Model) and GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System), hydrological models. We use the newest release of GRACE Level-2 products, i.\u2009e. RL06, provided by the CSR (Center for Space Research, Austin) analysis center in the form of a mascon solution. The analysis is performed for the European area, divided into 29 river basins. For each basin, the average signal is estimated. Then, annual amplitudes and trends are calculated. We found that the eastern part of Europe is characterized by the largest annual amplitudes of hydrology-induced Earth\u2019s crust deformations, which decrease with decreasing distance to the Atlantic coast. GLDAS largely overestimates annual amplitudes in comparison to GRACE and WGHM. Hydrology models underestimate trends, which are observed by GRACE. For the basin-related average signals, we also estimate the non-linear variations over time using the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). For the river basins situated on the southern borderline of Europe and Asia, large inter-annual deformations between 2004 and 2009 reaching a few millimeters are found; they are related to high precipitation and unexpectedly large drying. They were observed by GRACE but mismodelled in the GLDAS and WGHM models. Few smaller inter-annual deformations were also observed by GRACE between 2002-2017 for central and eastern European river basins, but these have been also well-covered by the WGHM and GLDAS hydrological models.</p></section>",

            "abstractNote": "The spatial, and temporal (seasonal and interannual) variations of some of atmospheric parameters over Lake Tana Basin, Ethiopia have been studied from 2001 to 2019 to understand their relationships among aerosol optical depth AOD) and rainfall. The origin and movement of air masses which bring aerosol particles have been studied by using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) values were found to be maximum during the summer season (June\u2013August), but minimum during the winter season (December\u2013February). The annual average of AOD over the Lake Tana Basin varies from 0.21 to 0.34 during 2001\u20132019 while monthly and seasonal AOD values vary between 0.05 and 0.32, and 0.07 and 0.25 respectively. The HYSPLIT air mass back trajectories model indicate that air masses were traced from Eritrean Plateau, Red sea, Arabian Peninsula, Gulf of Aden and Afar depression. The positive relationship between AOD and Angstrom exponent indicates that the fine mode aerosol particles dominate over the Tana Lake Basin. The stronger positive correlation coefficient between AOD and cloud fraction (CF) over the Gonder region (north of the Lake Tana Basin) as compared to that for Dangila region (south-west of the Lake Tana Basin; r\u202f=\u202f0.61 and r\u202f=\u202f0. 58 respectively), indicates the source of moisture from the Red Sea region. Nevertheless, the south-easterly increase in the spatial correlation between AOD and water vapor (WV) over the Lake Tana Basin suggests the prime source of moisture form the Western Indian Ocean. Thus, satellite derived AOD data are useful for the study of rainfall patterns.",

            "abstractNote": "The forecast of electricity demand in recent years is becoming increasingly relevant because of market deregulation and the introduction of renewable resources. To meet the emerging challenges, advanced intelligent models are built to ensure precise power forecasts for multi-time horizons. The use of intelligent forecasting algorithms is a key feature of smart grids and an effective tool of resolving uncertainty for better cost and energy efficiency decisions like scheduling the generations, reliability and power optimization of the system, and economic smart grid operations. However, prediction accuracy in forecasting algorithms is highly demanded since many important activities of power operators like load dispatch depend upon the short-term forecast. This paper proposes a model for the estimation of the consumption of electricity in Agartala, Tripura in India, which can accurately predict the next 24\u00a0h of load with and estimation of load for 1\u00a0week to 1\u00a0month. A number of specific characteristics in the city have been analysed in order to extract variables that could affect the pattern of electricity consumption directly. In addition, the present paper shows the way to significantly improve the accuracy of the prediction through ensemble machine learning process. We demonstrated the performance of individual Random forest and XGBoost along with their ensemble. The RF and XGBoost ensemble obtained an accuracy with an improvement of 15\u201329%. The analyses or findings also provide interesting results in connection with energy consumption.",

            "abstractNote": "A very severe cyclonic storm (VSCS), \u2018Ockhi\u2019 started its journey from southwest Bay of Bengal (BoB) over Comorin area (7.5\u00b0N\u201377.5\u00b0E) as a low-pressure area on 28 November, 2017. Initially it moved north-westwards across Lakshadweep Islands without hitting Tamil Nadu or Kerala coast, then moved north-eastward over the Arabian Sea and dissipated upon hitting south Gujarat coast on 06 December, 2017. Rapid intensification (RI), clockwise recurvature and a longer track were the major features of the VSCS, Ockhi. In the present study, an attempt has been made to understand the mechanism of cyclogenesis, RI and recurvature of the Ockhi using satellite and reanalysis datasets. Initially, role of easterly waves (EW) and Madden Jullian Oscillations (MJO) on the cyclogenesis of tropical cyclone Ockhi is addressed. Our analysis suggests that the EW (MJO) played a seminal (insignificant) role in preconditioning the atmosphere for the cyclogenesis of the Ockhi. Our detailed analysis using various oceanic parameters indicate that, the passage of the cyclonic storm over the regions of high thermal energy, especially warmer ocean mean temperature (OMT) at 100 m depth, was instrumental in its rapid intensification. Further, we addressed the recurving feature of the VSCS Ockhi using steering flow analysis. It is found that strong north-eastward steering winds, embedded in subtropical westerlies with deep southward extent, favoured the recurving of the Ockhi towards north-eastward by suppressing the conventional westward (north-westward) track movement.",

Statistical measures were employed to measure the performance in reproducing the rainfall and to assess its ability to detect the rainfall/no rainfall events, its structure, pattern, and spatio-temporal variations in the monthly and annual time scales. Compromise programming (CP) is used to rank the statistical performances of selected gridded precipitation data sets and found that TRMM attained first rank for the 8 stations followed by MERRA. The precipitation concentration index (PCI) checks the pattern and distribution of rainfall and found that observed data shows a uniform distribution in the basin; however, all the three gridded data sets failed to demonstrate uniform distribution. Categorical metrics like Probability of Detection (POD) and False Alarm Ratio (FAR) revealed that TRMM followed by MERRA and GPCC have good capabilities to detect rainfall/no rainfall events at different thresholds. All the trends drawn between observed data set and gridded precipitation data sets revealed that the MERRA data tend to underestimate and the TRMM and GPCC data tend to overestimate the values and intensities of rainfall data sets at most of the stations for both monthly and annual time scales. The data analysis of extreme rainfall points at monthly and annual time scales exhibits better performance of TRMM data sets. Overall, the TRMM data set is capable in replicating different characteristics of the observed data in the study area and could be used for hydro-meteorological and climatic studies when continuous observed data set is not available.",

The simplest partitioning method, which could provide low-latency information for managers at low cost, remains a purely optical classification based on ocean colour remote sensing. The question is whether such a simple approach has value. Here, the efficacy of optical classifications in constraining physical variables that modulate the epipelagic environment is tested for the tropical Indian Ocean, with a focus on the Chagos marine protected area (MPA). Using remote sensing data, it was found that optical classes corresponded to distinctive ranges of wind speed, wind stress curl, sea surface temperature, sea surface slope, sea surface height anomaly and geostrophic currents (Kruskal\u2013Wallis and post-hoc Tukey honestly significantly different tests, \u03b1 = 0.01). Between-class differences were significant for a set of sub-domains that resolved zonal and meridional gradients across the MPA and Seychelles\u2013Chagos Thermocline Ridge, whereas between-domain differences were only significant for the north\u2013south gradient (PERMANOVA, \u03b1 = 0.01). A preliminary test of between-class differences in surface CO2 concentrations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 demonstrated a small decrease in mean pCO2 with increasing chlorophyll (chl), from 418 to 398 ppm. Simple optical class maps therefore provide an overview of growth conditions, the spatial distribution of resources \u2014 from which habitat fragmentation metrics can be calculated, and carbon sequestration potential. Within the 17 year study period, biotic variables were found to have decreased at up to 0.025%a\u22121 for all optical classes, which is slower than reported elsewhere (Mann-Kendall-Sen regression, \u03b1 = 0.01). Within the MPA, positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions and negative Southern Oscillation Indices were weakly associated with decreasing chl, fluorescence line height (FLH), eddy kinetic energy, easterly wind stress and wind stress curl, and with increasing FLH/chl, sea surface temperature, SSH gradients and northerly wind stress, consistent with reduced surface mixing and increased stratification. The optical partitioning scheme described here can be applied in Google Earth Engine to support management decisions at daily or monthly scales, and potential applications are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "The Colombian power sector is highly dependent on hydroelectricity, making it vulnerable to both annual dry seasons and the droughts brought by the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). One efficient way to reduce such vulnerabilities is by introducing renewable energies that may complement the availability of hydroelectricity. This paper explores the degree of complementarity between solar and wind resources in Colombia and the country's hydropower sector, on both annual and interannual scales. Various correlation analyses are performed over four climatic variables: water inputs (runoff), precipitation, solar radiation, and wind speed, plus the Oceanic Ni\u00f1o Index (ONI), which helps to characterize ENSO events. The analysis is carried out over different geographic locations and seasons. The results indicate that solar and wind resources, particularly those in the Caribbean Coast and the central Andes regions, complement the hydropower sector during both the dry seasons of the annual climatological cycle and ENSO's warm and cold phases. Also, they show that complementarity varies, not just with the type of sources and location, but also with the seasons of the year and ENSO's stage of development. This paper provides an enhanced perspective on the behavior of renewables and offers an alternative viewpoint for designing the future expansion of power systems.",

            "abstractNote": "The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), as the \u201cthird pole of the earth\u201d, is China's the source of many driving ecological factors in China. However, in the context of increasing global change, the QTP is facing increasing ecological and environmental problems, such as vegetation degradation and land surface temperature (LST) changes. Here, we first analyzed the spatiotemporal trends in the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) and the LST. Then, we explored the relationship of vegetation and LST changes to climatic factors. Finally, we calculated the response relationship of the spatial and temporal changes in vegetation and LST to global climate change. The results show that from 2001 to 2016, the vegetation coverage on the QTP showed an overall upward trend, with significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The average annual increase in the OSAVI value was 0.0071, and the areas with significant OSAVI change trends accounted for 26.3% of the study area. Both OSAVI and LST showed a significant decreasing change trend with increasing altitude. From 2001 to 2016, the LST on the QTP generally showed an upward trend, with a variation of 0.3824\u00a0\u00b0C. Most of the LST peaks occured around July in each year, and climate warming will cause the peak time to occur earlier. In terms of spatial distribution, the change rate of the LST trend over the southern Himalaya and Hengduan Mountains was more than 40%. The LST in this area was negatively correlated with OSAVI, and the annual mean value of OSAVI showed a negative trend in this area, with a change rate of 10%. In the QTP region, from 2001 to 2016, climate change affected vegetation growth and surface temperature trends. During the growing season, spring and summer, OSAVI had a significant positive correlations with the atmospheric temperature (AT), but not with precipitation. In the same seasons, LST and AT showed very significant positive correlations, but were not correlated with precipitation. In autumn, OSAVI had no correlation with AT or precipitation, while LST had a positive correlation with AT and precipitation.",

For example, articles written on Lake Victoria referenced various figures for the dimensions of the lake (66,400\u201369,485 km22^2 for its area; 300\u2013412 km for its maximum length; 240\u2013355 km for its maximum width; and 3300\u20134828 km for its shorelines). These discrepancies are largely due to the difficulties of obtaining accurate data because of both the sheer size of the lake and the lack of resources that have been committed for exploratory research by regional governments. This chapter presents the work of Awange et al. [14] who uses a suite of remotely sensed Landsat, Sentinel-2, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Google Earth Pro imagery, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) rainfall, Multivariate El\u2019 Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index (MEI) and altimetry data for the past 34 years (1984\u20132018) together with exterior sources (37 published literature; 1969\u20132018) of the lake\u2019s physical parameters to (i) study changes in the physical parameters of the lake; surface area, shoreline, length, and width, and establish its current (2018) state, (ii) identify and analyse the lake\u2019s hotspots (i.e., regions with significantly noticeable areal changes), and (iii), assess the impacts of climate signature (seasonal, annual, and global ENSO teleconnection) and anthropogenic activities on the lake and its hotspots (see Fig. 8.1). To achieve these aims, manual digitization, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are employed for the analysis. The results indicate the mean area of the lake from the 1984, 2002, 2017 and 2018 images to be 69,295 km22^2 (i.e., 812 km 22^2 or 1.2% more than the mean value of the 37 sampled literatures), and the 2018 value to be 69,216 km22^2 (i.e., differs by \u223c\u223c\\sim 733 km22^2 (1.1%) from the mean value quoted in 37 previous studies sampled). As to whether the lake is actually dying, the study found that the largest tropical lake has shrunk compared to its 1984 areal value by 203 km22^2 (0.3%) due to both climate change and anthropogenic factors. This areal decrease primarily occurred in four regions identified as hotspots: Birinzi area (40%), Winam Gulf (20%), Emin Pasha Gulf (38%) and Mwanza Gulf (55%). Furthermore, these hotspots were affected by the expansion of Nalubaale dam during 2002\u20132006, with areal decreases of 31, 10, 21 and 44% in Birinzi, Winam Gulf, Emin Pasha Gulf and Mwanza Gulf areas, respectively. Seasonal analysis show an increase of 9 km22^2 in the lake\u2019s area during the heavy rainy seasons March-May (MAM) on the one hand, while on the other hand, the ENSO events enlarged the lake\u2019s area by 0.23 and 0.45% in 2007 and 2010, respectively.",

            "abstractNote": "Glazing transparency provides buildings with valuable solar energy during periods of colder weather, thus contributing to the mitigation of climate change. However, this same transparency also leads to heat loss which can offset heat gains. Although the use of insulated glazing addresses this challenge by multiplying the number of glass panes, at the same time it reduces the solar factor and thus the heating potential. This article aims to estimate the potential for passive solar heating in Europe according to the energy performance of glazing. This potential is undoubtedly a valuable resource for sustainable architecture. However, an analysis based on regional weather conditions shows a wide disparity in the energy savings that can be expected from a south-facing facade. These savings are most often well below a building\u2019s average energy consumption and so a balance has to be found between the thermal resistance and the solar factor of glazing. In addition, the carbon footprint and cost of the most efficient glazing can considerably extend the environmental and economic payback time of a retrofit. This research shows that the potential for passive solar heating is significant but only as long as each architectural situation is analysed according to its specific context and function. This potential would be even greater if windows were designed and used as adjustable facade elements to suit variations in weather and use.",

On 17 and 18 April 2010, a flash flood, caused by rainstorm over Meghalaya plateau, inundated the low-lying regions (locally known as Haors) of northeastern Bangladesh. Prediction of this sudden incident is challenging when it happened on the high terrain of Meghalaya plateau and adjoining Bangladesh. This study investigated the synoptic flow patterns and numerical features of the flash flood-producing storm and its associated tropospheric conditions in northeast Bangladesh using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The study revealed that the 48-h simulated rainfall was about 152 mm for outer domain-1, 195 mm for inner domain-2 and 209 mm for the innermost domain-3 whereas actual rainfall was 223 mm as recorded by BMD. For instance, in convection resolving resolution at 9 km and 3 km domain, the model error was 12.3% and 5.9% respectively.",

            "abstractNote": "Hydrological modeling is still a challenge for better management of water resources since most of the established models are based on point data. The advent, improvement and popularization of remote sensing has brought new perspectives to modelers, allowing access to reliable and representative data over vast areas. However, several tools are still under-explored and actually used in the water resources planning and decision-making process, especially groundwater, which is a hidden resource. The objective of this work was to contribute to groundwater dynamics comprehension assessing the suitability of using remote sensing data in the water-budget equation for estimating groundwater recharge (GWR) and its impact at water table depths (WTD) in a representative Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) outcrop area. The GAS is the largest transboundary groundwater reservoir in South America, yet recharge in the GAS outcrop zones is one of the least known hydrological variables. The remotely sensed WTD model was adapted from the Water Table Fluctuation (WTF) method. We used Google Earth Engine to extract time series of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and surface runoff from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) dataset for the Angatuba Ecological Station (EEcA), S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, over 2014\u20132017 period. GWR and WTD were modeled in eight groundwater monitoring wells. Bias analysis of precipitation data from FLDAS were perfomed using rain gauge data (2000\u20132018). Two GWR scenarios (S1 and S2) were assessed as well as the impact of the specific yield values ($${S}_{\\mathrm{y}}$$Sy) in the model outputs. In C1 GWR ranged from 10.8% to 19.69% of rain gauge, although in C2 GWR ranged from 0.9 to 13%. The WTD model showed RMSE values ranging from 0.36 to 1.12\u00a0m, showing better results in the shallow wells than the deeper ones. These results are useful for future studies on assessing groundwater recharge in the GAS outcrop zones. This remotely sensed approach can be reproduced in regions where data are scarce or nonexistent.",

            "abstractNote": "The oceans play a pivotal role in the carbon cycle due to its dynamics to act as a carbon source or sink to the atmosphere. Previous studies showed that the Java Sea acts as a carbon dioxide (CO2) source. However, their analysis was only based on the observation data which was limited in time and coverage. In the present study, we utilize the advantage of satellite measurements which have wide coverage and continues monitoring. Sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, sea surface salinity, surface wind speed, tropospheric mole fraction of CO2 and sea level pressure were analyzed to calculate CO2 gas transfer velocity, CO2 solubility, CO2 pressure in the sea water and atmosphere to estimate CO2 flux in the Java Sea. We found that the Java Sea acts as a CO2 source. However, during May 2015 and August 2016 small areas along the southern Borneo Island become the sink areas of CO2. The influence of CO2 gas transfer velocity and CO2 solubility is stronger than the difference of CO2 pressure between sea and atmosphere to determine CO2 flux in the Java Sea. Therefore, wind speed and sea surface salinity play important role to determine the variability of CO2 flux in the Java Sea. El Ni\u00f1o condition tends to amplify the release of CO2 to the atmosphere since CO2 gas transfer velocity, CO2 solubility and the difference of CO2 pressure between sea and atmosphere increases during El Ni\u00f1o.",

            "abstractNote": "Besides being the world's most populous country, China is also the top emitter of CO2 with power generation being the main culprit. Stretching between 2017 and 2050 a projection of the future Chinese electricity production is presented. Power generation forecasts derive from the Business As Usual (BAU), the Goals (Goals), the Renewables (RESc) and the Coal Free (CFr) scenarios. The RESc, consisting of renewables, hydro and batteries, is unable to meet electricity demand unless supplemented by fossil fuels. Bound by various constraints, natural gas is unlikely to act as a transition fuel to a low-carbon economy. At 0.207 $/kWh, the RESc yields the most expensive electricity which is twice as costly as the CFr and the Goals and 3 times more expensive than the BAU. Concerning CO2 emissions, the BAU will emit 7.26\u201312.34 Gigatonnes (Gt) compared to 2.57\u20134.76\u00a0Gt for the Goals, 0.79\u20132.03\u00a0Gt for the RESc and 0.68\u20131.47\u00a0Gt for the CFr by 2050. Both the CFr and Goals are the only ones that fulfil China's COP21 targets. Concluding, Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) are estimated to lower CO2 emissions by 1.06\u00a0Gt indicating that China's electricity sector can realize net-zero emissions only by phasing-out coal.",

Trend of equilibrium line altitude has been analysed for the period of 1979/80 to 2012/13 in Naradu Valley, western Himalaya. The clear effect of valley\u2019s increased temperature can be seen on ELA trend. The temperature, precipitation and few years ELA data have been used as an input parameters to develop a multiple linear regression equation. By using the developed equation, ELA of thirty four years has been reconstructed. Mann-Kendall and Spearman Rank Correlation tests have been applied to analyse the significance level. The reconstructed ELA data shows, a significant positive trend with a magnitude of 96.73\u202fm for the entire period. The monthly and seasonal analysis shows that the trend was positive. The magnitude of increased seasonal ELA was 4.02\u202fm/year, 3.24\u202fm/year, 2.84\u202fm/year, and 2.04\u202fm/year for post-monsoon, pre-monsoon, winter and monsoon respectively.",

            "abstractNote": "Deep convective systems (DCSs) are associated with severe weather events and can affect regional and global climate. To study the semi-diurnal variation of DCSs over Eastern China and its surrounding seas in summer, we modified the Tracking of Organized Convection Algorithm through a 3-D segmentatioN (TOOCAN) by employing Himawari-8 operational cloud property (CLP) products instead of original infrared images, and renamed the algorithm as TOOCAN-CLP. The DCSs detected over land and sea are divided into small-, medium-, and large-sized classes based on the convective core equivalent radius. The small and medium-sized DCSs over land exhibit a maximum occurrence in the afternoon, which is associated with local thermal instability and sea breeze circulation. The occurrence of small DCSs over the tropical sea areas varies analogously to that of small continental DCSs but with a smaller amplitude. However, medium-sized DCSs over the sea, which account for the majority of DCSs over the sea, exhibit weak semi-diurnal variability. Large DCSs over inland China and its surrounding seas tend to initiate at night and decay in the daytime. The generation of large DCSs over inland China at night is mainly due to the enhanced transport of warm and moist air by strong large-scale prevailing southerly or southwesterly winds, while the large offshore DCSs accompanied by heavy rainfall is closely associated with the interaction between local offshore breeze and large-scale monsoon flows, as well as gravity waves.",

            "abstractNote": "In August 2017, South Asia was affected by devastating floods that caused widespread death and destruction in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. The Brahmaputra River experienced a record flow in Bangladesh. However, the prediction of a 200-year flood from an international forecasting agency did not materialize. In fact, the evolution and dynamics of 2017 flood was very different from previous floods in the region\u2014localized in nature and short-lived in duration. We examine the hydrometeorology of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna River basins to show how the 2017 August flood emerged differently from past major floods in the region. Assessment of available rainfall datasets reveals the usefulness of satellite sources, such as TMPA, GPM, ERA-Interim, CPC Global Precipitation, and WRF to capture the extreme events and highlights the poor spatial coverage of in-situ measurements. We then present a data-driven Requisitely Simple (ReqSim) flood forecast model. Findings from the real-time application of ReqSim during the 2017 flood provide encouraging results with accurate predictions of peak flood timing and magnitude for several locations. For example, the ReqSim provides 10-day forecasts with Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values 0.89\u20130.97 and Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) 0.33\u20130.54\u00a0m for the Ganges River system inside Bangladesh. For the Brahmaputra River system, NSE value ranges 0.49\u20130.68 and MAE 0.32\u20130.48\u00a0m for 10-day forecasts and NSE 0.62\u20130.78 and MAE 0.36\u20130.68\u00a0m for 7-day forecasts. Comparison of 2017 flood with past major regional floods suggests that\u2014it is not the intensity of rainfall or severity of flood in either the Ganges or the Brahmaputra basin\u2014but the lack of peak flow synchronization of these two rivers may help explain why 2017 flood did not become as severe as the floods of 1998 and 2007 in Bangladesh. Ease of operationalization and reliable forecasting accuracy of ReqSim for 2017 flood is of particular relevance for large rivers, where access to upstream gauge-measured rainfall and flow data are limited, and detailed modeling approaches are operationally prohibitive and functionally ineffective.\nPlain language summary\nVast areas of South Asia\u2014across the border regions of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh\u2014were flooded by intense rainfall and overflowing rivers in August 2017. This record flood event killed over a thousand people and affected over 40 million people. However, forecasts of a 200-year flood event, issued by an international agency and covered widely in local media outlets, did not materialize. It was found that the evolution and dynamics of 2017 flood was very different from previous major floods in the region\u2014localized in nature and short-lived in duration. We examine the rainfall and flood generating processes before and during the floods and the performance of a simple flood forecast model in detail to identify the mechanisms that led to these apparent false forecasts including the nature and timing of the peak rainfall events and subsequent floods.",

Here, we estimate monthly ocean LHF at 4 km spatial resolution over 5 years using bulk algorithm COARE 3.0, driven by satellite data and meteorological variables from reanalysis. We validated the estimated ocean LHF by multiyear observations and by comparison with seven ocean LHF products. Validation results from monthly observations at 96 widely distributed buoy sites from three buoy site arrays (TAO, PIRATA, and RAMA) indicated a bias of less than 7 W/m2 with R2 of more than 0.80 () and with a King\u2013Gupta efficiency (KGE) of over 0.84. Our estimated ocean LHF also performs well in simulating annual variability and predicting between-site variability, as indicated by a bias of lower than 6 W/m2 and an R2 of more than 0.84 (). Overall, the average KGE for estimated ocean LHF increased by 18%\u201323% compared to other LHF products, indicating robust LHF estimation performance. Importantly, our estimated annual ocean LHF has similar global spatial distribution compared to other LHF products, although there are general differences in LHF values due to the difference in the models and the spatial resolution.",

In comparison with the original land surface data in the Community Land Model version 4 (ORG), the new data features notable land use and land cover change (LULCC) with increased forests over northeastern Asia and Alaska by decreasing shrublands and grasslands. Overestimated bare land cover over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the Rocky Mountains in the ORG are corrected with the replacements by grasslands and shrublands respectively in the new data. The model simulation results show that with the introduction of the ESA CCI-LC, the simulated surface albedo, surface net radiation flux, sensible and latent heat fluxes are relatively improved over the regions where significant LULCC exists, such as northeastern Asia, Alaska, the TP, and Australia. Surface air temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation are improved in boreal winter but degraded in summer. The winter warming over northeastern Asia results from increased longwave downwelling flux and adiabatic heating while the notable winter cooling over Alaska is attributed to strong cold advection followed by reduced longwave downwelling flux. LULCC alters precipitation by influencing water vapor content. In winter, LULCC affects atmospheric circulation via modulating baroclinicity while in summer, it influences land-sea thermal contrast, thus affecting the intensity of East Asian summer monsoon. LULCC also alters the simulated dust burden.",

Smoke from large wildfires can travel long distances and have a harmful effect on human health, the environment, and climate in other areas. More recently, in 2018&ndash;2019 there have been many large fires. This study focused on the wildfires that occurred in the United States of America (USA), Brazil, and Australia using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) and a TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Specifically, we analyzed the spatial-temporal distribution of black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) and the vertical distribution of smoke. Based on the results, the highest detection of smoke (~14 km) was observed in Brazil; meanwhile, Australia showed the largest BC column burden of ~1.5 mg/m2. The meteorological conditions were similar for all sites during the fires. Moderate temperatures (between 32 and 42 &deg;C) and relative humidity (30&ndash;50%) were observed, which resulted in drier conditions favorable for the burning of fires. However, the number of active fires was different for each site, with Brazil having 13 times more active fires than the USA and five times more than the number of active fires in Australia. However, the high number of active fires did not translate to higher atmospheric constituent emissions. Overall, this work provides a better understanding of wildfire behavior and the role of meteorological conditions in emissions at various sites.",

High-energy short-wavelength ultraviolet B (UVB) is biologically effective, influencing a range of dermal processes, including the potentially beneficial production of vitamin D. In addition to the damaging effects of UVB, the longer wavelength and more abundant ultraviolet A (UVA) has been shown to be linked to an increased risk of skin cancer. To evaluate this risk requires the monitoring of the solar UVA globally on a time repetitive basis in order to provide an understanding of the environmental solar UVA irradiance and resulting exposures that humans may receive during their normal daily activities. Satellite-based platforms, with the appropriate validation against ground-based instrumentation, can provide global monitoring of the solar UVA environment. Two satellite platforms that currently provide data on the terrestrial UVA environment are the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) and the global ozone monitoring experiment (GOME-2). The objectives of this review are to provide a summary of the OMI and GOME-2 satellite-based platforms for monitoring the terrestrial UVA environment and to compare the remotely sensed UVA data from these platforms to that from ground-based instrumentation.",

The summer temperature anomaly is manifested in the decline of polar mesospheric clouds. The 2-day wave is a strong-amplitude and transient summer feature that interacts with the background state so as to warm the high-latitude summer mesopause. This wave has been linked to a low-latitude phenomenon called inertial instability, which is organized by breaking planetary waves in the winter stratosphere. Hence, inertial instability has been identified as a possible nexus between the disturbed winter stratosphere, and summer mesopause warming. We investigate a sustained occurrence of inertial instability during 19 July\u20138 August 2014. During this period, stratospheric winter temperatures warmed by about 10 K, while a steep decline in polar mesospheric clouds was reported between 26 July and 6 August. We present, for the first time, wave driving associated with observed inertial instability. The effect of inertial instability is to export eastward momentum from the winter hemisphere across the equator into the summer hemisphere. Using a primitive equation model, we demonstrate that the wave stresses destabilize the stratopause summer easterly jet. The reconfigured wind profile excites the wavenumber-4 component of the 2-day wave, leading to enhanced warming of the summer mesopause. This work supports previous numerical investigations that identified planetary wave\u2013driven inertial instability as a source of the 2-day wave.</p></section>",

This dust is thought to carry micronutrients that could help fertilize the rainforest. However, considering different atmospheric transport conditions, different aridity levels in South America and Africa and active volcanism, it is not clear if the same pathways for dust have occurred throughout the Holocene. Here we present analyses of Sr-Nd isotopic ratios of a lacustrine sediment core from remote Lake Pata in the Amazon region that encompasses the past 7,500 years before present, and compare these ratios to dust signatures from a variety of sources. We find that dust reaching the western Amazon region during the study period had diverse origins, including the Andean region and northern and southern Africa. We suggest that the Sahara Desert was not the dominant source of dust throughout the vast Amazon basin over the past 7,500 years.",

This area of South America exhibits strong land\u2013atmosphere coupling in the warm season. In this work, we evaluate the impact of large-scale soil moisture (SM) anomalies on regional-scale atmospheric conditions. Multivariate empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is used to extract the dominant modes of joint variability of monthly averaged root-zone SM and 1-month-lagged precipitation from atmospheric reanalyses. We find that the dominant EOF pattern is consistent with a positive correlation between antecedent SM and precipitation, while the second dominant EOF pattern is consistent with a negative correlation between these variables. To evaluate causality, the effects of large-scale SM anomalies on atmospheric variables are examined using the Community Earth System Model (CESM). CESM simulations suggest that anomalously dry SM is initially collocated with decreased precipitation. Subsequent changes in the atmospheric circulation associated with a thermal low draw moisture into the region, eventually promoting increased precipitation. This study investigates the pathways through which SM anomalies modulate precipitation in this region. For this reason, this study has potential atmospheric prediction applications that could benefit the population and the socioeconomic well-being of this important region.</p></section>",

The Noah-MP LSM is used to simulate water and energy fluxes and states, which are transformed into drought categories using percentiles over the continental U.S. from 1979 to 2017. Leaf Area Index (LAI) observations are assimilated into the dynamic vegetation scheme of Noah-MP. A weekly operational drought monitor (the U.S. Drought Monitor) is used for the evaluation. The results show that LAI assimilation into Noah-MP\u2019s dynamic vegetation scheme improves the model's ability to represent drought, particularly over cropland areas. LAI assimilation improves the simulation of the drought category, detection of drought conditions, and reduces the instances of drought false alarms. The assimilation of LAI in these locations not only corrects model errors in the simulation of vegetation, but also can help to represent unmodeled physical processes such as irrigation towards improved simulation of agricultural drought.</p></section>",

Previous research has attempted to reconcile this discrepancy by using climate model simulations with constrained tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) to account for the role of internal variability. Here the relationships between Hadley cell extent and internal SST variability and long-term warming are analyzed using purely observational techniques. Using linearly independent components of SST variability with reanalysis datasets, the statistical relationship between Pacific variability and Hadley cell extent is quantified by time scale. There is a strong correlation between North Pacific decadal SST variability and Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell extent. Conversely, there is a weaker observed relation between El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Hadley cell extent when low-frequency variability is filtered out of the ENSO signal. The observed linear sensitivity of Hadley cell width to long-term warming agrees with coupled general circulation model experiments when accounting for uncertainties, and there is a statistically significant relationship between Northern Hemisphere Hadley cell extent and long-term warming during boreal autumn.</p></section>",

Further, the impact of the LDAS-derived SM and ST initialization on simulation of pre-monsoon (March\u2013May) thunderstorms over the Gangetic West Bengal region are assessed. The high-resolution (4\u00a0km and hourly) land surface conditions such as SM and ST data are prepared for the period from 2010 to 2013 using the LDAS forced with various insitu observations from Automatic Weather Stations (AWS), Meteorological Aviation Reports (METAR), and micro-meteorological tower observations over India. Four thunderstorm (TS) events during the pre-monsoon season of 2010 are considered for the numerical experiments using climatological SM and ST at coarser resolution (CNTR) and LDAS-generated high-resolution SM and ST (WLDAS) for initializing the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The efficacy of the LDAS-generated SM and ST data are verified against micro-meteorological tower observations at Kharagpur, West Bengal, and the results indicate the magnitude and variation in the data product are close to observations. The initialization of high-resolution LDAS-generated SM and ST in the WRF improves the simulation of near-surface air temperature, humidity, and pressure at Kharagapur. Most importantly, the location and timing of the storm are relatively better simulated in the WLDAS than CNTR over the Kolkata region. The study encourages the use of more local observations in the generation of high-resolution SM and ST data for application in the simulation of pre-monsoon TSs.",

            "abstractNote": "Regional seasonal forecasting requires accurate simulation of the variability of local climate drivers. The South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) is a large region of low-level convergence, clouds and precipitation in the South Pacific, whose effects extend as far as northeast Australia (NEA). The location of the SPCZ is modulated by the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which causes rainfall variability in the region. Correctly simulating the ENSO-SPCZ teleconnection and its interplay with local conditions is essential for improving seasonal rainfall forecasts. Here we analyse the ability of the ACCESS-S1 seasonal forecast system to predict the SPCZ\u2019s relationship with ENSO including its latitudinal shifts, zonal slope and rainfall magnitude between 1990 and 2012 for the December\u2013January\u2013February (DJF) season. We found improvements in ACCESS-S1\u2019s SPCZ prediction capability compared to its predecessor (POAMA), although prediction of the slope is still limited. The inability of ACCESS-S1 to replicate seasons with a strong anti-zonal SPCZ slope is attributed to its atmospheric model. This has implications for accurate seasonal rainfall forecasts for NEA and South Pacific Islands. Future challenges in seasonal prediction facing regional communities and developers of coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere forecast models are discussed.",

Based on reanalysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research and ozone observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, the authors investigated the dynamical variation of the stratospheric polar vortex during winter 2019\u20132020 and its influence on surface weather and ozone depletion. This strong stratospheric polar vortex was affected by the less active upward propagation of planetary waves. The seasonal transition of the stratosphere during the stratospheric final warming event in spring 2020 occurred late due to the persistence of the polar vortex. A positive Northern Annular Mode index propagated from the stratosphere to the surface, where it was consistent with the Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation indices. As a result, the surface temperature in Eurasia and North America was generally warmer than the climatology. In some places of Eurasia, the surface temperature was about 10 K warmer during the period from January to February 2020. The most serious Arctic ozone depletion since 2004 has been observed since February 2020. The mean total column ozone within 60\u00b0\u201390\u00b0N from March to 15 April was about 80 DU less than the climatology. \u6458\u8981 2019-2020\u51ac\u5b63\u5317\u6781\u5e73\u6d41\u5c42\u6781\u6da1\u5f02\u5e38\u5e76\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u504f\u5f3a,\u504f\u51b7.\u5229\u7528NCEP\u518d\u6570\u636e\u548cOMI\u81ed\u6c27\u6570\u636e, \u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6b64\u6b21\u5f3a\u6781\u6da1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5e73\u6d41\u5c42\u6781\u6da1\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u573a\u6f14\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5730\u9762\u6696\u51ac\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u81ed\u6c27\u4f4e\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd.\u6b64\u6b21\u5f3a\u6781\u6da1\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4f20\u884c\u661f\u6ce2\u4e0d\u6d3b\u8dc3.\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5f3a\u6781\u6da1\u4f7f\u5f972020\u5e74\u6625\u5b63\u7684\u6700\u540e\u589e\u6e29\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u665a.\u5e73\u6d41\u5c42\u6b63NAM\u6307\u6570\u5411\u4e0b\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u5730\u9762, \u4e0e\u5730\u9762AO\u6307\u6570\u548cNAO\u6307\u6570\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4, \u6b27\u4e9a\u5927\u9646\u548c\u5317\u7f8e\u5730\u9762\u6c14\u6e29\u5747\u6bd4\u6c14\u5019\u6001\u504f\u6696, \u5728\u6b27\u4e9a\u5927\u9646\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5730\u533a, 2020\u5e741\u6708\u548c2\u6708\u7684\u6c14\u6e29\u751a\u81f3\u504f\u9ad8\u4e8610K.2020\u5e742\u6708\u4ee5\u6765\u5317\u6781\u81ed\u6c27\u51fa\u73b0\u4e862004\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u503c, 2020\u5e743-4\u670860\u00b0\u201390\u00b0N\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u81ed\u6c27\u67f1\u603b\u91cf\u6bd4\u6c14\u5019\u6001\u504f\u4f4e\u4e8680DU.",

            "abstractNote": "Surface PM2.5 concentrations are required for exposure assessment studies. Remotely sensed Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has been used to derive PM2.5 where ground data is unavailable. However, two key challenges in estimating surface PM2.5 from AOD using statistical models are (i) Satellite data gaps, and (ii) spatio-temporal variability in AOD-PM2.5 relationships. In this study, we estimated spatially continuous (0.03\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20090.03\u00b0) daily surface PM2.5 concentrations using MAIAC AOD over Madhya Pradesh (MP), central India for 2018 and 2019, and validated our results against surface measurements. Daily MAIAC AOD gaps were filled using MERRA-2 AOD. Imputed AOD together with MERRA-2 meteorology and land use information were then used to develop a linear mixed effect (LME) model. Finally, a geographically weighted regression was developed using the LME output to capture spatial variability in AOD-PM2.5 relationship. Final Cross-Validation (CV) correlation coefficient, r2, between modelled and observed PM2.5 varied from 0.359 to 0.689 while the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) varied from 15.83 to 35.85\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0m\u22123, over the entire study region during the study period. Strong seasonality was observed with winter seasons (2018 and 2019) PM2.5 concentration (mean value 82.54 \u00b5g\u00a0m\u22123) being the highest and monsoon seasons being the lowest (mean value of 32.10\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0m\u22123). Our results show that MP had a mean PM2.5 concentration of 58.19\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0m\u22123 and 56.32\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0m\u22123 for 2018 and 2019, respectively, which likely caused total premature deaths of 0.106 million (0.086, 0.128) at the 95% confidence interval including 0.056 million (0.045, 0.067) deaths due to Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), 0.037 million (0.031, 0.045) due to strokes, 0.012 million (0.009, 0.014) due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and 1.2 thousand (1.0, 1.5) due to lung cancer (LNC) during this period.",

The approaches include both an aggregated vehicle representation and individual driving profiles of passenger EVs. The driving patterns of 426 randomly selected vehicles in Sweden were recorded between 30 and 73 days each and used as input to the electricity system model for the individual driving profiles. The main conclusion is that an aggregated vehicle representation gives similar results as when including individual driving profiles for most scenarios modelled. However, this study also concludes that it is important to represent the heterogeneity of individual driving profiles in electricity system optimisation models when: (i) charging infrastructure is limited to only the home location in regions with a high share of solar and wind power in the electricity system, and (ii) when addressing special research issues such as impact of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) on battery health status. An aggregated vehicle representation will, if the charging infrastructure is limited to only home location, over-estimate the V2G potential resulting in a higher share (up to 10 percentage points) of variable renewable electricity generation and an under-estimation of investments in both short- and long-term storage technologies.",

The climatological features of LSO indicate a peak minimum in the southern flank of ASMA noticed by the geopotential measurements from MLS. Further, the temporal variability of LSO indicates significant interannual variability during the 15\u00a0years of MLS observations. Our analysis found that two prominent source regions control the LSO variability at interannual time scales in the ASMA region, associated with the Pacific and Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures. More importantly, the extreme (positive/negative) values in ozone anomalies coincide with the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation(El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a) events. Further, the composite analysis reveals a significant change in the mean magnitude of LSO of about 10\u00a0ppb between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a phases. The results indicate that reduced water vapor transport due to subsidence and suppressed convection during the El Ni\u00f1o phase leads to less mixing across the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, therefore, causing higher concentrations of ozone and vice-versa during the La Ni\u00f1a phase. Hence, this study indicates a strong implication for the climatic perturbations over the ASMA region.",

            "abstractNote": "Following past studies to quantify decadal trends in global carbon monoxide (CO) using satellite observations, we update estimates and find a CO trend in column amounts of about \u22120.50 % per year between 2002 to 2018, which is a deceleration compared to analyses performed on shorter records that found \u22121 % per year. Aerosols are co-emitted with CO from both fires and anthropogenic sources but with a shorter lifetime than CO. A combined trend analysis of CO and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from space helps to diagnose the drivers of regional differences in the CO trend. We use the long-term records of CO from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and AOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. Other satellite instruments measuring CO in the thermal infrared, AIRS, TES, IASI, and CrIS, show consistent hemispheric CO variability and corroborate results from the trend analysis performed with MOPITT CO. Trends are examined by hemisphere and in regions for 2002 to 2018, with uncertainties quantified. The CO and AOD records are split into two sub-periods (2002 to 2010 and 2010 to 2018) in order to assess trend changes over the 16 years. We focus on four major population centers: Northeast China, North India, Europe, and Eastern USA, as well as fire-prone regions in both hemispheres. In general, CO declines faster in the first half of the record compared to the second half, while AOD trends show more variability across regions. We find evidence of the atmospheric impact of air quality management policies. The large decline in CO found over Northeast China is initially associated with an improvement in combustion efficiency, with subsequent additional air quality improvements from 2010 onwards. Industrial regions with minimal emission control measures such as North India become more globally relevant as the global CO trend weakens. We also examine the CO trends in monthly percentile values to understand seasonal implications and find that local changes in biomass burning are sufficiently strong to counteract the global downward trend in atmospheric CO, particularly in late summer.",

            "abstractNote": "Flood management is an important topic worldwide. Precipitation is the most crucial factor in reducing flood-related risks and damages. However, its adequate quality and sufficient quantity are not met in many parts of the world. Currently, near real-time satellite precipitation products (NRT SPPs) have great potential to supplement the gauge rainfall. However, NRT SPPs have several biases that require corrections before application. As a result, this study investigated two statistical bias correction methods with different parameters for the NRT SPPs and evaluated the adequacy of its application in the Fuji River basin. We employed Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP)-NRT and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG)-Early for NRT SPPs as well as BTOP model (Block-wise use of the TOPMODEL (Topographic-based hydrologic model)) for flood runoff simulation. The results showed that the corrected SPPs by the 10-day ratio based bias correction method are consistent with the gauge data at the watershed scale. Compared with the original SPPs, the corrected SPPs improved the flood discharge simulation considerably. GSMaP-NRT and IMERG-Early have the potential for hourly river-flow simulation on a basin or large scale after bias correction. These findings can provide references for the applications of NRT SPPs in other basins for flood monitoring and early warning applications. It is necessary to investigate the impact of number of ground observation and their distribution patterns on bias correction and hydrological simulation efficiency, which is the future direction of this study.",

            "abstractNote": "Aims: This study examines the dynamics of malaria as influenced by meteorological factors in French Guiana from 2005 to 2019. It explores spatial hotspots of malaria transmission and aims to determine the factors associated with variation of hotspots with time. Methods: Data for individual malaria cases came from the surveillance system of the Delocalized Centers for Prevention and Care (CDPS) (n = 17) from 2005\u20132019. Meteorological data was acquired from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) database. The Box\u2013Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model tested stationarity of the time series, and the impact of meteorological indices (issued from principal component analysis\u2014PCA) on malaria incidence was determined with a general additive model. Hotspot characterization was performed using spatial scan statistics. Results: The current sample includes 7050 eligible Plasmodium vivax (n = 4111) and Plasmodium falciparum (n = 2939) cases from health centers across French Guiana. The first and second PCA-derived meteorological components (maximum/minimum temperature/minimum humidity and maximum humidity, respectively) were significantly negatively correlated with total malaria incidence with a lag of one week and 10 days, respectively. Overall malaria incidence decreased across the time series until 2017 when incidence began to trend upwards. Hotspot characterization revealed a few health centers that exhibited spatial stability across the entire time series: Saint Georges de l\u2019Oyapock and Antecume Pata for P. falciparum, and Saint Georges de l\u2019Oyapock, Antecume Pata, R\u00e9gina and Camopi for P. vivax. Conclusions: This study highlighted changing malaria incidence in French Guiana and the influences of meteorological factors on transmission. Many health centers showed spatial stability in transmission, albeit not temporal. Knowledge of the areas of high transmission as well as how and why transmission has changed over time can inform strategies to reduce the transmission of malaria in French Guiana. Hotspots should be further investigated to understand other influences on local transmission, which will help to facilitate elimination.",

            "abstractNote": "The temporal variations in a vertical reference frame depend on the variations in the reference surface (e.g., the geoid), and in the surface where the benchmarks are located. The mass redistribution on and beneath the Earth\u2019s surface generates changes in the geoid, which is the reference surface for orthometric heights. To model the phenomena and processes that affect Earth\u2019s gravity field, the maintenance of a high-precision global physical reference frame that considers its temporal variations is necessary. In this contribution, we estimate and analyze the impact of three geophysical signals, namely mega-earthquakes (Mw > 7.5), hydrological loadings, and glacial isostatic adjustment over the South American vertical reference frames based on the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment monthly solutions, glacial isostatic adjustment, and hydrological models. Our results reveal that long-term trends range from \u22120.5 to 0.3 mm/year, which implies possible height variations up to 10 mm over 20 years. These results point out the possibilities for maintaining modern vertical reference frames if variations in the trends (e.g., due to accelerations) are disregarded. The seasonal variations (from peak to peak), co-seismic deformation, and post-seismic deformation reach 31 mm, 3.8 mm, and 0.8 mm, respectively. According to wavelet analysis based on the independent components (IC) obtained from independent component analysis, it was observed that the predominant signal has one cycle per year. The first four ICs represent 94.4% of the geoid variability. The spatial patterns of the four modes indicated that geoid variations are concentrated in the Amazon, Tocantins, Parana, and Sao Francisco river basins. Temporal variations of the geoid in South America reach magnitudes that should be considered in the evolution of height systems to accomplish the requirements of a modern height system (accuracy on the order of 10 mm or better).",

A total of 368-nights observations succeeded for 2 winter seasons, and 3 cases in which $$\\text {N}_2^+$$Meinel (1,2) band around $$1.5\\,\\mu \\text {m}$$was significant were identified. Focusing on two specific cases, detailed spectral characteristics with high temporal resolutions of 30 s are presented. Intensities of $$\\text {N}_2^+$$band were estimated to be 228 kR and 217 kR just at the moment of the aurora breakup and arc intensification during pseudo breakup, respectively. At a wavelength of $$\\text {P}_1(2)$$line ($$\\sim 1523 \\,\\text {nm}$$), $$\\text {N}_2^+$$emissions were almost equal to or greater than the OH line intensity. On the other hand, at a wavelength of $$\\text {P}_1(4)$$line ($$\\sim 1542 \\,\\text {nm}$$), the OH line was not seriously contaminated and still dominant to $$\\text {N}_2^+$$emissions. Furthermore, we evaluated $$\\text {N}_2^+$$(1,2) band effects on OH rotational temperature estimations quantitatively for the first time. Auroral contaminations from $$\\text {N}_2^+$$(1,2) band basically lead negative bias in OH rotational temperature estimated by line-pair-ratio method with $$\\text {P}_1(2)$$and $$\\text {P}_1(4)$$lines in OH (3,1) band. They possibly cause underestimations of OH rotational temperatures up to 40 K. In addition, $$\\text {N}_2^+$$(1,2) band contaminations were temporally limited to a moment around the aurora breakup. This is consistent with proceeding studies reporting that enhancements of $$\\text {N}_2^+$$(1,2) band were observed associated with International Brightness Coefficient 2\u20133 auroras. It is also suggested that the contaminations would be neglected in the polar cap and the sub-auroral zone, where strong aurora intensification is\u00a0less observed. Further spectroscopic investigations at these wavelengths are needed especially for more precise evaluations of $$\\text {N}_2^+$$(1,2) band contaminations. For example, simultaneous 2-D imaging observation and spectroscopic measurement with high spectral resolutions for airglow in OH (3,1) band will make great advances in more robust temperature estimations in the auroral zone.",

Our main objective is to analyze the spatiotemporal changes of two climatic variables in Indian subcontinent for the period of 2015\u20132020. Monthly precipitation and temperature data are collected from NOAA and NASA for January to May month across the four zones (northeast, northwest, central, and peninsular zone) of India. To conduct a zone-wise statistical analysis, we have adopted statistical process control (SPC) methods like exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts, individual charts (I- Chart) to detect the shift in temperature and precipitation over the study period and Pearson correlation coefficient applied to measure the spatial association between the two variables. The findings revealed that temperature parameter has experienced a lot of positive and negative trends in the span of 6\u00a0years and detected a weak to moderate negative correlation in many parts of the country in April 2020 after 2016. This study also identified a weak negative correlation mainly in NE zone in 2020 after 2017. This research provides vital scientific contribution to the effects of monthly temperature and precipitation before and after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.\n\nGraphic abstract",

Cross-spectral analysis and lag-regression analysis both showed that coherent rainfall variations accompany not only the wavenumber-1 gravest Rossby mode (\u201c5-day\u201d wave) but other low-frequency modes. The normal mode rainfall variations are enhanced in regions such as the Amazon basin, but also include circumglobally traveling structures with substantial amplitude over the open ocean. These results are remarkably consistent among the three datasets including even ERA5 rainfall data. The circumglobal rainfall signals may be considered primarily as a response to the normal mode dynamical variations. We found that the phase relationship between rainfall and dynamical field variability is strongly dependent on the type of mode and even on the zonal wavenumber. We suggest that this is explained by the difference in relative importance of two underlying processes: 1) moisture-flux convergence and 2) rainfall enhancement associated with adiabatic cooling. Our determined rainfall signals are the response to quasi-monochromatic, periodic waves that have a simple vertical structure and represent one special case of tropospheric wave\u2013rainfall coupling. Implications for the mechanism of 12-h rainfall oscillations believed to be forced by the atmospheric tide are also considered.</p></section>",

We computed the radiative forcing at the top and bottom of the atmosphere between 0.2 and 4 microns using the libRadTran package and compared the results with those provided by AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork). Lidar measurements were employed to characterize the aerosol vertical profile, and collocated AERONET measurements provided aerosol optical parameters required to calculate its radiative forcing. A good correlation between the calculated radiative forcings and those provide by AERONET, with differences smaller than 1 W m\u22122 (15% of estimated radiative forcing), is obtained when a gaussian vertical aerosol profile is assumed. Notwithstanding, when a measured aerosol profile is inserted into the model, differences between radiative forcings can vary up to 6.54 W m\u22122 (15%), with a mean of differences = \u22120.74 \u00b1 3.06 W m\u22122 at BOA and \u22123.69 W m\u22122 (13%), with a mean of differences = \u22120.27 \u00b1 1.32 W m\u22122 at TOA due to multiple aerosol layers and aerosol types. These results indicate that accurate information about aerosol vertical distribution must be incorporated in the radiative forcing calculation in order to reduce its uncertainties.",

            "abstractNote": "The spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation is of great importance for the rain-fed agricultural production and the socioeconomics of Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil. MT has a sparse network of ground rain gauges that limits the effective use of precipitation information for sustainable agricultural production and water resources in the region. Several gridded precipitation products from remote sensing and reanalysis of land surface models are currently available that can enhance the use of such information. However, these products are available at different spatial and temporal resolutions which add some challenges to stakeholders (users) to identify their appropriateness for specific applications (e.g., irrigation requirements, length of growing season, and drought monitoring). Thus, it is necessary to provide an assessment of the reliability of these precipitation estimates. The objective of this work was to compare regional precipitation estimates over MT as provided by the Global Land Data Assimilation (GLDAS), Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) with ground-based measurements. The comparison was conducted for the 2000\u20132018 period at eleven ground-based weather stations that covered different climate zones in MT using daily, monthly, and annual temporal resolutions. The comparison used the Pearson correlation index\u2013r, Willmott index\u2013d, root mean square error\u2014RMSE, and the Wilks methods. The results showed GPM and GLDAS estimates did not differ significantly with the measured daily, monthly, and annual precipitation. TRMM estimates slightly overestimated daily precipitation by about 4.7% but did not show significant difference on the monthly and annual scales when compared with local measurements. The GPCP underestimated annual precipitation by about 7.1%. MERRA underestimated daily, monthly, and annual precipitation by about 22.9% on average. In general, all products satisfactorily estimated monthly precipitation, and most of them satisfactorily estimated annual precipitation; however, they showed low accuracy when estimating daily precipitation. The TRMM, GPM, GPCP, and GLDAS estimates had the highest performance, from high to low, while MERRA showed the lowest performance. The findings of this study can be used to support the decision-making process in the region in application related to water resources management, sustainability of agriculture production, and drought management.",

This study examines the climatology of warm season (March\u2013September) flash drought occurrence in the United States between 1979 and 2014, and quantifies the possible impacts of vegetation on flash drought based on a set of sensitivity experiments using the Community Earth System Model, version 2 (CESM2). With atmospheric nudging, CESM2 well captures historical flash drought. Compared with NASA\u2019s Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), and National Climate Assessment\u2013Land Data Assimilation System (NCA-LDAS), CESM2 shows agreement on the high flash drought frequency in the Great Plains and southeastern United States, but overestimates flash drought occurrence in the Midwest. The vegetation sensitivity experiments suggest that vegetation greening can significantly increase the flash drought frequency in the Great Plains and the western United States during the warm seasons through enhanced evapotranspiration. However, flash drought occurrence is not significantly affected by vegetation phenology in the eastern United States and Midwest due to weak land\u2013atmosphere coupling. In response to vegetation greening, the extent of flash drought also increases, but the duration of flash drought is not sensitive to greening. This study highlights the importance of vegetation in flash drought development, and provides insights for improving flash drought monitoring and early warning.</p></section>",

            "abstractNote": "The use of neural networks in hydrology has been frequently undermined by limitations regarding the quantification of uncertainty in predictions. Many authors have proposed different methodologies to overcome these limitations, such as running Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian approximations, and bootstrapping training samples, which come with computational limitations of their own, and two-step approaches, among others. One less-frequently explored alternative is to repurpose the dropout scheme during inference. Dropout is commonly used during training to avoid overfitting. However, it may also be activated during the testing period to effortlessly provide an ensemble of multiple \u201csister\u201d predictions. This study explores the predictive uncertainty in hydrological models based on neural networks by comparing a multiparameter ensemble to a dropout ensemble. The dropout ensemble shows more reliable coverage of prediction intervals, while the multiparameter ensemble results in sharper prediction intervals. Moreover, for neural network structures with optimal lookback series, both ensemble strategies result in similar average interval scores. The dropout ensemble, however, benefits from requiring only a single calibration run, i.e., a single set of parameters. In addition, it delivers important insight for engineering design and decision-making with no increase in computational cost. Therefore, the dropout ensemble can be easily included in uncertainty analysis routines and even be combined with multiparameter or multimodel alternatives.",

In this study, we used the random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) methods to downscale groundwater storage (GWS) from 1\u00b0 (~110 km) to 1 km by downscaling Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data from 1\u00b0 (~110 km) and 0.25\u00b0 (~25 km) respectively, to 1 km for China. Three evaluation metrics were employed for the testing dataset for 2004\u22122016: The R2 ranged from 0.77\u22120.89 for XGBoost (0.74\u22120.86 for RF), the correlation coefficient (CC) ranged from 0.88\u22120.94 for XGBoost (0.88\u22120.93 for RF) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.37\u22122.3 for XGBoost (0.4\u22122.53 for RF). The R2 of the XGBoost models for GLDAS was 0.64\u22120.82 (0.63\u22120.82 for RF), the CC was 0.80\u22120.91 (0.80\u22120.90 for RF) and the RMSE was 0.63\u22121.75 (0.63\u22121.77 for RF). The downscaled GWS derived from GRACE and GLDAS were validated using in situ measurements by comparing the time series variations and the downscaled products maintained the accuracy of the original data. The interannual changes within 9 river basins between pre- and post-downscaling were consistent, emphasizing the reliability of the downscaled products. Ultimately, annual downscaled TWS, GLDAS and GWS products were provided from 2004 to 2016, providing a solid data foundation for studying local GWS changes, conducting finer-scale hydrological studies and adapting water resources management and policy formulation to local condition.",

            "abstractNote": "High resolutions of satellite\u00a0rainfall products have\u00a0been widely used for hydrometeorological and hydroclimatological studies over the globe. However, the performance of satellite rainfall estimates varies and is affected by topography and atmospheric characteristics. The assessment of satellite rainfall products is important over different regions. In\u00a0this study, Integrated Multi-SatellitE Retrievals\u2019 performance for the Global Precipitation Mission version 6 (GPM-IMERG v6) was evaluated\u00a0before and after bias correction, over the Lake Hawassa catchment. A linear scaling bias correction approach was used to correct the bias of\u00a0GPM-IMERG early and late\u00a0rainfall products. The satellite rainfall products were also compared with ground observed rainfall data in the Lake Hawassa catchment. Statistical performance assessing methods were used to evaluate both raw and bias-corrected IMERG early and late rainfall products. The percentage of bias (PBIAS) for early and late rainfall\u00a0estimates was 91.54 and 77.03, respectively, for the entire periods\u00a0before bias correction. It indicates that GPM-IMERG overestimated rainfall relative to ground-gauged rainfall. The results show that IMERG rainfall products are in good agreement with ground observed rainfall after bias correction. The correlation values (R) for IMERG early and late is 0.86 and 0.85, respectively, indicating a good correlation between IMERG\u2019s estimated rainfall and observed rainfall after bias correction. The performance of IMERG rainfall estimates\u00a0varies with the seasons. The bias correction\u00a0for only rainy season shows\u00a0a good match with observed rainfall\u00a0 compared to all seasons.\u00a0Bias-correction resulted in a good match between estimated and observed rainfall. Generally, evaluation of\u00a0GPM-IMERG satellite rainfall products\u00a0is essential prior to use for hydrological modeling and forecasting in data-scarce areas.",

The present study is aimed at analyzing the long-term (2004\u20132016) concentration patterns of CO2 and CH4 over Malawi located in Southeast Africa using the observations from Atmospheric Infrared Sounding (AIRS). The study found an annual increase concentration of CO2 and CH4, with a rate of 7.08% and 1.66%, respectively; whereas, the respective concentration levels of CO2 and CH4 in 2016 were noted as >400\u00a0ppm and >750\u00a0ppb, which is comparable to that reported by IPCC (2014) over the globe. The monthly and seasonal analyses revealed that high patterns are associated with biomass burning season, changes in vegetation cover, and long-range transport. The two trace gases were seasonally correlated with carbon-containing compounds produced from incomplete combustion and biomass burning. The trace gases and pollutants are emitted from the burning of crop residues during the harvesting season, besides, open burning of forests and vehicular emissions. The present study also detected a seasonal increase in CO2 and CH4 concentrations during JJA and SON seasons. The temperature (T \u00b0C) exhibited profound correlation with CO2 (r\u00a0=\u00a00.75, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and CH4 (r\u00a0=\u00a00.80, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) during the pollution peak season of SON. Moreover, CO2 and CH4 showed significant positive correlation with cloud top temperature (r\u00a0=\u00a00.56, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and r\u00a0=\u00a00.74, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively) and negative correlation with cloud fraction (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.55, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.69, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively) during SON, imply extensive climatic effect by the trace gases during high pollution season. The backward air mass trajectories divulge a contribution of distant produced pollutants from neighboring Mozambique, Madagascar Islands, and the South American continent. The major sinks of tropospheric CO2 and CH4 observed from the present study are precipitation and vegetation.",

            "abstractNote": "Smoke aerosols emitted by wildfires can ascend to the free troposphere, travel over long distances and descend to affect local air quality (AQ) in downwind areas. This study investigates the AQ impact of long-range transported (LRT) smoke aerosols from western North America during summer 2017 in New York State (NYS) using observations and numerical products. Analysis of total fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon measurements at Queens and Buffalo shows that about 38% and 43% of the polluted events are related to the LRT smoke aerosols, respectively. Two LRT smoke events transported from the Pacific Northwest to NYS on Sep. 5 and 16, 2017, are analyzed. The transport path is determined by the large-scale flow (positive tilted trough for the 1st case and stationary front for the 2nd case). During both events, smoke aerosols were entrained into the boundary layer during the growth of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and accumulated near surface when the PBL collapsed. The enhanced aerosol mass is primarily due to carbonaceous and secondary sulfate aerosols. Although the two events differed in aerosol loadings (150 versus 80\u202fmg\u202fm\u22122 for column mass density), weather conditions (cold front passage versus high-pressure system), and entrainment rates (6 versus 12\u202fcm\u202fs\u22121), the AQ impacts were comparable for two events (about 10\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm\u22123 increase of total PM2.5). Our study of two smoke cases indicates that the LRT smoke events even with moderate intensity would degrade local AQ if the underlying meteorological conditions are favorable for downward mixing.",

In this study, we evaluate the ability of two precipitation estimates from the latest Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG Final Run V06, hereafter referred to as IMERG-F) and its predecessor, the TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA research product 3B42V7, hereafter referred to as TMPA), to capture TCP at daily, event, and annual scales by comparing the satellite observations with gauge measurements based on data from 2014 to 2018. The results show that both TMPA and IMERG-F are able to accurately capture the general TCP patterns. IMERG-F provides a noticeable improvement in accuracy over TMPA, especially for times and locations with light and heavy TCP. However, both IMERG-F and TMPA still systematically underestimate TCP during extreme events. At the annual scale, both TMPA and IMERG-F slightly underestimate annual TCP, but IMERG-F to a lesser degree. For individual TC events, IMERG-F has lower bias and a higher Nash\u2013Sutcliffe efficiency than TMPA in the majority of the events. The differences between IMERG-F and TMPA are especially pronounced for extreme TCP events, such as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. At the daily scale, both IMERG-F and TMPA underestimate TCP when daily TCP exceeds ~150 mm. However, IMERG-F shows closer agreements with gauge-based measurements than TMPA. This study demonstrates that IMERG-F can more accurately measure TCP than TMPA. However, there are still systematic biases in IMERG-F when it comes to heavy TCP at all of the time scales.</p></section>",

This study aims to assess the air quality by monitoring major atmospheric pollutants such as AOD, CO, PM2.5, NO2, O3 and SO2 in 15 major cities of India using Air Quality Zonal Modeling. The study is based on two different data sources; (a) grid data (MODIS- Terra, MERRA-2, OMI and AIRS, Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, NASA) and (b) ground monitoring station data provided by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) / State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). The remotely sensed data demonstrated that the concentration of PM2.5 has declined by 14%, about 30% of NO2 in million-plus cities, 2.06% CO, SO2 within the range of 5 to 60%, whereas the concentration of O3 has increased by 1 to 3% in majority of cities compared with pre lockdown. On the other hand, CPCB/SPCB data showed more than 40% decrease in PM2.5 and 47% decrease in PM10 in north Indian cities, more than 35% decrease in NO2 in metropolitan cities, more than 85% decrease in SO2 in Chennai and Nagpur and more than 17% increase in O3 in five cities amid 43\u00a0days pandemic lockdown. The restrictions of anthropogenic activities have substantial effect on the emission of primary atmospheric pollutants.",

We use 9452 (5044) h of lidar observations at K\u00fchlungsborn [Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR)]. Filtering according to vertical wavelength (<em>\u03bb</em><sub><em>z</em></sub> &lt; 15 km) or period (<em>\u03c4</em> &lt; 8 h) is applied. Gravity wave potential energy densities (GWPED) per unit volume (<em>E</em><sub>pV</sub>) and per unit mass (<em>E</em><sub>pm</sub>) are derived. GWPED from reanalysis are smaller compared to lidar. The difference increases with altitude in winter and reaches almost two orders of magnitude around 70 km. A seasonal cycle of <em>E</em><sub>pV</sub> with maximum values in winter is present at both stations in nearly all lidar and SABER measurements and in reanalysis data. For SABER and for lidar (with <em>\u03bb</em> &lt; 15 km) the winter/summer ratios are a factor of ~2\u20134, but are significantly smaller for lidar with <em>\u03c4</em> &lt; 8 h. The winter/summer ratios are nearly identical at both stations and are significantly larger for <em>E</em><sub>pm</sub> compared to <em>E</em><sub>pV</sub>. Lidar and SABER observations show that <em>E</em><sub>pV</sub> is larger by a factor of ~2 at K\u00fchlungsborn compared to ALOMAR, independent of season and altitude. Comparison with mean background winds shows that simple scenarios regarding GW filtering, etc., cannot explain the K\u00fchlungsborn\u2013ALOMAR differences. The value of <em>E</em><sub>pV</sub> decreases with altitude in nearly all cases. Corresponding <em>E</em><sub>pV</sub>-scale heights from lidar are generally larger in winter compared to summer. Above ~55 km, <em>E</em><sub>pV</sub> in summer is almost constant with altitude at both stations. The winter\u2013summer difference of <em>E</em><sub>pV</sub> scale heights is much smaller or absent in SABER and in reanalysis data.</p></section>",

            "abstractNote": "Air-to-sea deposition of water-soluble total nitrogen (WSTN) can influence the primary productivity in the coastal oceans. Here, we assessed the concentrations of aerosol inorganic (WSIN: NH4+ + NO3\u2212) and WSTN over the Arabian Sea during winter season (SS379:6\u201324 December 2018). The mean concentrations of NH4+ (109\u00a0\u00b1\u00a083\u00a0nmol\u00a0m\u22123) overwhelm that of NO3\u2212 (32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0nmol\u00a0m\u22123) and water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON: WSTN-WSIN: 86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a081\u00a0nmol\u00a0m\u22123), and contributing to ~50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031% of WSTN mass. Significant linear relationships of WSON with water-soluble organic carbon and NH4+ with non-sea-salt (nss)-K+ is observed suggesting their common origin from biomass burning and fertilizers. Backward air mass trajectories and satellite-based fire counts further revealed their provenance in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and southern India. The concentration of NO3\u2212 moderately correlated with nssCa2+ (dust tracer), indicating heterogeneous reactive uptake on mineral aerosol surface. Despite high concentrations, the deposition fluxes of NH4+ (~9.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.1\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122 d\u22121) and WSON (7.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.0\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122 d\u22121) are lower than NO3\u2212 (27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122 d\u22121) because of their predominant fine nature (i.e., strong correlation with nss-SO42\u2212). We also constrained the total annual atmospheric deposition rates of WSIN (0.94 Tg yr\u22121) and WSON (0.08 Tg yr\u22121) to the Arabian Sea during the continental outflow (November-April). The maximum dry-deposition of WSON to the Arabian Sea (0.24 Tg yr\u22121) is twice that of the riverine supply (0.11 Tg yr\u22121), highlighting the significance of aeolian sources. By using Redfield Stoichiometry, the WSTN deposition (21\u201373\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122 d\u22121) can account for <5.3% of fixed\u2011carbon by a primary production in the Arabian Sea.",

The PBL height (PBLH) represents the maximum height of the free atmosphere that is directly influenced by the Earth\u2019s surface. This study uses a multi-data synthesis approach from an ensemble of multiple global datasets of radiosonde observations, reanalysis products and climate model simulations to examine the spatial patterns of long-term PBLH trends over land between 60\u00b0S and 60\u00b0N for the period 1979-2019. By considering both the sign and statistical significance of trends, we identify large-scale regions where the change signal is robust and consistent to increase our confidence in the obtained results. Despite differences in the magnitude and sign of PBLH trends over many areas, all datasets reveal a consensus on increasing PBLH over the enormous and driest Sahara Desert and Arabian Peninsula (SDAP) and declining PBLH in India. At the global scale, the changes in PBLH are significantly correlated positively with the changes in surface heating and negatively with the changes in surface moisture, consistent with theory and previous findings in the literature. The rising PBLH is in good agreement with increasing sensible heat and surface temperature and decreasing relative humidity over the SDAP associated with desert amplification<strong>,</strong> while the declining PBLH resonates well with increasing relative humidity and latent heat and decreasing sensible heat and surface warming in India. The PBLH changes agree with radiosonde soundings over the SDAP but cannot be validated over India due to lack of good-quality radiosonde observations.</p></section>",

            "abstractNote": "We revisit the notion of climate, along with its historical evolution, tracing the origin of the modern concerns about climate. The notion (and the scientific term) of climate was established during the Greek antiquity in a geographical context and it acquired its statistical content (average weather) in modern times after meteorological measurements had become common. Yet the modern definitions of climate are seriously affected by the wrong perception of the previous two centuries that climate should regularly be constant, unless an external agent acts upon it. Therefore, we attempt to give a more rigorous definition of climate, consistent with the modern body of stochastics. We illustrate the definition by real-world data, which also exemplify the large climatic variability. Given this variability, the term \u201cclimate change\u201d turns out to be scientifically unjustified. Specifically, it is a pleonasm as climate, like weather, has been ever-changing. Indeed, a historical investigation reveals that the aim in using that term is not scientific but political. Within the political aims, water issues have been greatly promoted by projecting future catastrophes while reversing true roles and causality directions. For this reason, we provide arguments that water is the main element that drives climate, and not the opposite.",

            "abstractNote": "Coastal southeast Florida experiences a wide range of aerosol conditions, including African dust, biomass burning (BB) aerosols, as well as sea salt and other locally-emitted aerosols. These aerosols are important sources of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which play an essential role in governing cloud radiative properties. As marine environments dominate the surface of Earth, CCN characteristics in coastal southeast Florida have broad implications for other regions with the added feature that this site is perturbed by both natural and anthropogenic emissions. This study investigates the influence of different air mass types on CCN concentrations at 0.2% (CCN0.2%) and 1.0% (CCN1.0%) supersaturation (SS) based on ground site measurements during selected months in 2013, 2017, and 2018. Average CCN0.2% and CCN1.0% concentrations were 373 \u00b1 200 cm-3 and 584 \u00b1 323 cm-3, respectively, for four selected days with minimal presence of African dust and BB (i.e., background days). CCN concentrations were not elevated on the four days with highest influence of African dust (289 \u00b1 104 cm-3 [0.2% SS] and 591 \u00b1 302 cm-3 [1.0% SS]), consistent with high dust mass concentrations comprised of coarse particles that are few in number. In contrast, CCN concentrations were substantially enhanced on the five days with the greatest impact from BB (1408 \u00b1 976 cm-3 [0.2% SS] and 3337 \u00b1 1252 cm-3 [1.0% SS]). Ratios of CCN0.2%:CCN1.0% were used to compare the hygroscopicity of the aerosols associated with African dust, BB, and background days. Average ratios were similar for days impacted by African dust and BB (0.54 \u00b1 0.17 and 0.55 \u00b1 0.17, respectively). A 29% higher average ratio was observed on background days (0.71 \u00b1 0.14), owing in part to a strong presence of sea salt and reduced presence of more hydrophobic species such as those of a carbonaceous or mineral-dust nature. Finally, periods of heavy rainfall were shown to effectively decrease both CCN0.2% and CCN1.0% concentrations. However, the rate varied at which such concentrations increased after the rain. This work contributes knowledge on the nucleating ability of African dust and BB in a marine environment after varying periods of atmospheric transport (days to weeks). The results can be used to understand the hygroscopicity of these air mass types, predict how they may influence cloud properties, and provide a valuable model constraint when predicting CCN concentrations in comparable situations.",

The analysis includes: the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) retrieval and its single frequency counterparts, the GPM Combined Radar Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA), the CloudSat Snow Profile product (2C-SNOW-PROFILE) and two passive microwave retrievals, i.e., the Goddard PROFiling algorithm (GPROF) and the Snow retrievaL ALgorithm fOr gMi (SLALOM). The 2C-SNOW retrieval has the highest Heidke Skill Score (HSS) for detecting snowfall among the products analysed. SLALOM ranks second; it outperforms GPROF and the other GPM algorithms, all detecting only 30% of the snow events. Since SLALOM is trained with 2C-SNOW, it suggests that the optimal use of the information content in the GMI observations critically depends on the precipitation training dataset. All the retrievals underestimate snowfall rates by a factor of two compared to MRMS. Large discrepancies (RMSE of 0.7 to 1.5 mm h<sup>-1</sup>) between space-borne and ground-based snowfall rate estimates are attributed to the complexity of the ice scattering properties and to the limitations of the remote sensing systems: the DPR instrument has low sensitivity, while the radiometric measurements are affected by the confounding effects of the background surface emissivity and of the emission of supercooled liquid droplet layers.</p></section>",

In this study, we used multiple variables including precipitation, vegetation index, surface soil moisture, and evapotranspiration obtained from different satellite sources to study their association with land-cover changes in the Mediterranean region. Both observational and modeling data were used for climatology and correlation analysis. Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) were used to extract surface soil moisture and evapotranspiration data. Intercomparing the results of FLDAS and GLDAS suggested that FLDAS data had better accuracy compared to GLDAS for its better coherence with observational data. Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with Station Data (version 2.0 final) (CHIRPS Pentad) were used to extract precipitation data while Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products were used to extract the vegetation indices used in this study. The land-cover change detection was demonstrated during the 2009\u20132018 period using MODIS Land-Cover data. Some of the barren and crop lands in Euphrates-Tigris and Algeria have converted to low-vegetated shrublands over the time, while shrublands and barren areas in Egypt\u2019s southwestern Delta region became grasslands. These observations were well explained by changing trends of hydrological variables which showed that precipitation and soil moisture had higher values in the countries located to the east of the Mediterranean region compared to the ones on the west. For evapotranspiration, the countries in the north had lower values except for countries in Europe such as Bosnia, Romania, Slovenia, and countries in Africa such as Egypt and Libya. The enhanced vegetation index appeared to be decreasing from north to south, with countries in the north such as Germany, Romania, and Czechia having higher values, while countries in the south such as Libya, Egypt, and Iraq having lower trends. Time series analysis for selected countries was also done to understand the change in hydrological parameters, including Enhanced Vegetation Index, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture, which showed alternating drop and rise as well as stagnant values for different parameters in each country.",

            "abstractNote": "There was a significant decline in air pollution in different parts of the world due to enforcement of lockdown by many countries to check the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In particular, commercial and industrial activities had been limited globally with restricted air and surface traffic movements in response to social distancing and isolation. Both satellite remote sensing and ground-based monitoring were used to measure the change in the air quality. There was momentous decline in the averaged concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), methane (CH4) and aerosols. Many cities across India, China and several major cities in Europe observed strong reductions in nitrogen dioxide levels dropping by around 40\u201350% owing to lockdowns. Similarly, concentrations of SO2 in polluted areas in India, especially around large coal-fired power plants and industrial areas decreased by around 40% as evidenced by the comparative satellite mapping during April 2019 and April 2020. Recent advances in sensors on board various satellites played a significant role in real-time monitoring of emission regimes over various parts of the world. The satellite data is relying upon single scene profusion for real-time air quality measurements, and also using averaged dataset over certain time-period. The daily global-scale remote sensing data of NO2, as measured through the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (S5p/TROPOMI) of European Space Agency (ESA), indicated exceptional decreases in tropospheric NO2\u00a0pollution in urban areas. Similarly, Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, with a repeat cycle of three days helped in assessing the sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4 on a sub-continental scale.",

This study examines the compliance and enforcement of SO2 mitigation policies in China\u2019s coal-fired power plants from both temporal and spatial perspectives with Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) level 2 sulfur dioxide total column product (OMSO2 v003). We apply a pixel-averaging method with the pixel size being 0.02 x 0.02 degree, the time range being one year, and the averaging radius being 18 km. Results show that SO2 Vertical Column Density (VCD) enhancements of coal-fired power plants decreased by 94.3 % from January 2006 to April 2020. Most of the reduction took place in two compliance episodes, being in 2008 and after 2014. They can be related to the \u201cdesulfurized electricity tariff\u201d and the \u201cultra-low emission\u201d policies that entered into effect in July 2007 and from September 2013, respectively. Furthermore, the SO2 VCD enhancements rebounded in 2006 and 2011, the first years of 11th and 12th Five-Year Plans to reflect more relaxed enforcement and compliance. Policy enforcement differed significantly across provinces as indicated by when their coal-fired power plants complied and how much reduction was made. Environmental supervision and inspection could target those provinces with poorer compliance statuses for more effectively and efficiently enforcement.",

The increase in brightness paired with the decrease in polarization was registered, and the changes were especially noticeable in the dusk segment. The altitude distribution of aerosol particles and their mean size were found with previously developed techniques. The median radius of the lognormal distribution (0.11 \u03bcm) is typical of the background conditions or weak eruptions; however, the aerosols were mostly concentrated in the upper troposphere and near the tropopause rather than in the stratosphere. From comparison with satellite data obtained almost a decade ago after similar eruptions (like those of the Kasatochi volcano and others), it has been shown that the properties of their aerosols are similar, which confirms that the purple light phenomenon observed in 2019 was of volcanic origin.",

            "abstractNote": "The rapid Arctic sea ice retreat in the early 21st century is believed to be driven by several dynamic and thermodynamic feedbacks, such as ice-albedo feedback and water vapor feedback. However, the role of clouds in these feedbacks remains unclear since the causality between clouds and these processes is complex. Here, we use NASA CERES satellite products and NCAR CESM model simulations to suggest that summertime low clouds have played an important role in driving sea ice melt by amplifying the adiabatic warming induced by a stronger anticyclonic circulation aloft. The upper-level high pressure regulates low clouds through stronger downward motion and increasing lower troposphere relative humidity. The increased low clouds favor more sea ice melt via emitting stronger longwave radiation. Then decreased surface albedo triggers a positive ice-albedo feedback, which further enhances sea ice melt. Considering the importance of summertime low clouds, accurate simulation of this process is a prerequisite for climate models to produce reliable future projections of Arctic sea ice.",

            "abstractNote": "Vegetation optical depth (VOD) is a remotely sensed indicator characterizing the attenuation of the Earth's thermal emission at microwave wavelengths by the vegetation layer. At L-band, VOD is used to estimate the global biomass, a key component of the Earth's surface and of the carbon cycle. This study focuses on the behaviour of L-band VOD (L-VOD) retrieval algorithm over seasonally inundated areas, as some previous observations have shown an unexpected decline in VOD during flooding events. To analyse such variations, a passive microwave model was used to simulate the signal emitted by a mixed scene composed of soil and standing water. The retrieval over this inundated scene led to an overestimation of soil moisture (SM) and an underestimation of L-VOD. The phenomenon is more pronounced over grasslands than over forests, since low vegetation is mostly submerged under water and becomes invisible to the sensor; and since more standing water is visible to the sensor. The estimated L-VOD is typically reduced by ~10% over flooded forests and up to 100% over flooded grasslands. Such effects can distort the analysis of aboveground biomass (AGB) and aboveground carbon (AGC) dynamics based on L-VOD estimates. We evaluated that AGB can be underestimated by 15/20\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121 in the largest seasonal wetlands, which can represent more than 50% of the actual AGB of these fields, and up to higher values during exceptional meteorological years. Consequently, to better estimate the global biomass, surface water seasonality has to be taken into account in passive microwave retrieval algorithms.",

            "abstractNote": "Monitoring surface deformation associated with geohazards is a prerequisite for geological disaster prevention. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has the ability to capture ground deformation of landslides with high precision over a large area. However, in mountainous regions this capability is often limited by decorrelation noise and atmospheric phase artifacts. Over Eldorado National Forest, California, where many landslides need to be monitored and investigated, InSAR images are severely affected by atmospheric noise and the coherence is highly variable throughout the year, challenging InSAR techniques to effectively detect movement of active landslides. In order to obtain reliable measurements, we have designed an interferogram selection method and an InSAR segment processing (SP) technique to improve the deformation measurement. Compared with the traditional non-segment processing (NSP), the SP technique has demonstrated advantages in reducing the impact of atmospheric noise. Our results from both the ascending and descending InSAR datasets based on SP indicate that many landslides along the Highway 50 corridor were creeping at a rate of less than 10\u00a0cm/year during the investigation period. We have found that landslide movements in the study region present obvious seasonal patterns. The precipitation and pore-water measurements and our hydrogeological diffusion models suggest that the seasonal movements of these landslides are primarily driven by the pore-water pressures, and the peak deformation of the landslides may occur in the dry season (May to October) due to the time lag of precipitation infiltration. In addition, we have observed subtle upward movement of the landslides after the precipitation begins, which is likely caused by the swelling of clay-rich landslide body due to an increase in the pore pressure. Furthermore, several other localized unstable regions which may contain potential landslide hazards were also detected and mapped in the study area, and their dynamics need further investigation. We conclude that InSAR is capable of detecting slow landslide motions over difficult terrains if associated artifacts in the interferograms are suppressed. InSAR time-series measurements along with hydrogeological models enable us to characterize the time delay between peaks of landslide motions and precipitation.",

GRACE provided a first global observational record of water mass redistribution at spatial scales greater than 63000\u2009km2. This limits their usability in regional hydrological applications. In this study, we implement a statistical downscaling approach that assimilates 0.5\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u00b0 water storage fields from the WaterGAP hydrology model (WGHM), precipitation fields from 3 models, evapotranspiration and runoff from 2 models, with GRACE data to obtain TWSC at a 0.5\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u00b0 grid. The downscaled product exploits dominant common statistical modes between all the hydrological datasets to improve the spatial resolution of GRACE. We also provide open access to scripts that researchers can use to produce downscaled TWSC fields with input observations and models of their own choice.",

            "abstractNote": "Accurate estimation of the water conservation is of great significance for ecological red line planning. The water conservation of the Yellow River Basin has a vital influence on the development of the environment and the supply of ecological services in China. However, the existing methods used to estimate water conservation have many disadvantages, such as requiring numerous parameters, a complex calculation model, and using data that is often difficult acquire. It is often hard to provide sufficiently precise parameters and data, resulting in a large amount of calculation time and the difficulties in the study of large scale and long time series. In this study, a time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was applied to estimate water conservation in two aspects using the idea of wholeness and stratification, respectively. The overall fitting results can explain nearly 30% of the water conservation by partial least squares regression and nearly 50% of it by a support vector machine. However, the results of a stratified simulation showed that water conservation and the NDVI have a certain stratified heterogeneity among different ecosystem types. The optimal fitting result was achieved in a water/wetland ecosystem with the highest coefficient of determination (R2P) of 0.768 by the stratified support vector machine (SVM) model, followed by the forest and grassland ecosystem (both R2P of 0.698). The spatial mapping results showed that this method was most suitable for grassland ecosystem, followed by forest ecosystem. According to the results generated using the NDVI time series data, it is feasible to complete a spatial simulation of water conservation. This research can provide a reference for calculating regional or large-scale water conservation and in ecological red line planning.",

            "abstractNote": "Thunderstorms source of lightning discharge is a major hazard to humans. In India, the loss of human life due to thunderstorms is high because of frequent lightning during pre-monsoon season (March-May). Therefore, simulation of lightning flash counts based on various lightning parameterization schemes and Lightning Potential Index (LPI) in Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are evaluated over Maharashtra, India. The offline diagnostic methods for calculating lightning flashes are also evaluated from the model generated storm parameters. The observation from Maharashtra Lightning Detection Network (LDN) is used to validate the simulated total lightning flash for four events. The lightning flashes calculations by following Price and Rind (1992) based on cloud top height (PR92CTH) and vertically integrated ice water path (IWP) simulated the spatial pattern comparably well. The lightning parameterization based on cloud top height defined by the radar reflectivity factor threshold of 20 dBZ (DLP2) has performed better as compared to observation. The results show (i) better spatial pattern and frequency distribution of lightning flashes, (ii) accumulated rainfall, maximum reflectivity and time evolutions are in good agreement with flashes, (iii) correlation between simulated flash and hydrometeors are higher, (iv) the number of matching grid boxes due to randomness is also higher, 74.9%, 56.5%, 68.1% and 82.7% of matching grid boxes for the four cases and (v) the results based on LPI are also in consistent with the results of DLP2. The study highlights the robustness of DLP2 and indicates a promising future for the operational forecast of lightning prediction.",

            "abstractNote": "The rapid decline of groundwater levels (GWL) due to pervasive groundwater abstraction in the densely populated (~1 billion) Indus-Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (IGBM) transboundary river basins of South Asia, necessitates a robust framework of prediction and understanding. While few localized studies exist, three-dimensional regional-scale characterization of GWL prediction is yet to be implemented. Here, \u2018support vector machine\u2019, a machine-learning-based method, is applied to data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and data on land-surface-model-based groundwater storage and meteorological variables, to predict the GWL anomaly (GWLA) in the IGBM. The study has three main objectives, (1) to understand the spatial (observation well locations) and subsurface (shallow vs. deep observation wells) variability in prediction results for in-situ GWLA data for a large number of observation wells (n\u2009=\u20094,791); (2) to determine its relationship with groundwater abstraction, and; (3) to outline the advantages and limitations of using GRACE data for predicting GWLAs. The findings, based on individual observation well results, suggest significant prediction efficiency (median statistics: r\u2009>\u20090.71, NSE\u2009>\u20090.70; p\u2009<\u20090.05) in most of the IGBM; however, the study identifies hotspots, mostly in the agriculture-intensive regions, having relatively poor model performance. Further analysis of the subsurface depth-wise prediction statistics reveals that the significant dominance of pumping in the deeper depths of the aquifer is linked to the relatively poor model performance for the deep observation wells (screen depth\u2009>\u200935\u00a0m) compared with the shallow observation wells (screen depth\u2009<\u200935\u00a0m), thus, highlighting the limitation of GRACE in representing spatial and depth-dependent local-scale pumping.",

            "abstractNote": "Soil is the largest organic carbon pool in the terrestrial biosphere, and a small variation of soil organic carbon (SOC) can substantially affect the global carbon cycle and climate. Climate change is a major driver affecting the dynamics of SOC; however, our understanding about the responses of SOC in alpine ecosystems to climate change is quite limited. In particular, the differences of SOC dynamics at different depths were rarely reported. In this study, we investigated the impacts of precipitation variations and warming on SOC dynamics at both top and deep soils in the Qilian Mountains in Northwestern China using a machine learning approach and climate sensitivity experiments. Our simulation revealed the temporal inconsistency between topsoil SOC (in the top 20\u00a0cm, denoted as SOC20) and deeper soil SOC dynamics\u2014SOC20 showed a decreasing trend since 2009 which is earlier than that (2012) in the top 100\u00a0cm soil (SOC100). We also found that SOC100 may be more sensitive to warming due to the strengthened microbial decomposition rate and additional carbon source through deepened active layer. On the contrary, SOC20 presented more intense responses to precipitation than SOC100, which was mainly attributed to the different responses of upland and lowland SOC to precipitation variations. Our projection indicated that SOC20 may not substantially change under future climate trajectories because the enriched SOC induced by increased precipitation may offset the carbon loss via warming. However, SOC100 was projected to decrease significantly due to the enhanced carbon emissions via warming induced strengthened decomposition rate, additional carbon source from the deepened active layer, and exposed soil carbon to the atmosphere caused by ground subsidence and disrupted soil horizons resulting from thawed frozen soil. In brief, this study deepened our understanding of the mechanism of climate effect on SOC dynamics and can be helpful for regional soil ecological security assessment and risk projection.",

The temporal variations in BC concentration throughout a year and the location of its main sources are analyzed. The average values for two cold and two warm half-years were 128 and 62 ng/m3, respectively. The BC concentration in near-surface atmosphere was compared with MERRA-2 reanalysis data. On a monthly scale, the anomalous increase in BC concentration during short-term smoke aerosol transport across the observation area is more clearly revealed from the reanalysis data, rather than by values measured at a single point. Daily monitoring allows us to detect the specific dates of such situations.",

            "abstractNote": "The lack of ground-based observation data usually limits the analysis of extreme precipitation and streamflow, especially for the ungauged or data-limited regions. Satellite-based precipitation products (SPPs) with high temporal and spatial resolutions can provide potential data sources in the regions without adequate precipitation data, and it has received much attention of regional or global hydro-climatic analysis. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of four widely used long time series SPPs (CHIRPS, TMPA, CMORPH and PERSIANN) in capturing extreme precipitation and streamflow events in a humid region of southern China. It is found that, for extreme precipitation detection, both CMORPH and TMPA can capture most heavy and extreme precipitation, CMORPH works better on the rainfall distribution characteristics, while TMPA shows the best performance in capturing the extreme precipitation events with relatively low RMSE, ME and BIAS, and high R values of extreme precipitation indices. For the streamflow simulation, the combinations of different inputs and different models present different model performances. TMPA provides the most accurate hydrological model simulation results, while simulated streamflow forced by CMORPH exhibits considerable underestimation of streamflow. However, the combination of CMORPH and VIC model obtains the best efficiency for detecting extreme streamflow, followed by the combination of TMPA and SWAT model, which indicates the selection of a suitable model and input data is essential to obtain reliable and accurate results for the detection of extreme streamflow. This study is expected to provide a valuable reference for the application and comparison of multiple SPPs and models at watershed scales.",

            "abstractNote": "NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) was designed to support the quantification and monitoring of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Its Snapshot Area Map (SAM) and target mode measurements provide an innovative dataset for carbon studies on sub-city scales. Unlike any other current space-based instrument, OCO-3 has the ability to scan large contiguous areas of emission hot spots like cities, power plants, and volcanoes. These measurements result in dense, fine-scale spatial maps of column averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2). For the first time, we present and analyze XCO2 distributions over the Los Angeles megacity (LA) derived from OCO-3 SAM and target mode observations. Urban XCO2 enhancements range from 0 \u2212 6 ppm (median enhancements \u2243 2\u00a0ppm) relative to a clean background and show excellent agreement with nearby ground-based TCCON measurements of XCO2. OCO-3's dense observations reveal intra-urban variations of XCO2 over the city that have never been observed from space before. The spatial variations are mainly driven by the complex fossil fuel emission patterns and meteorological conditions in the LA Basin and are in good agreement with those from co-located TROPOMI measurements of co-emitted NO2. Differences between measured and simulated XCO2 enhancements from two models (WRF-Chem and X-STILT) are typically below 1\u00a0ppm with larger differences for some sub regions. Both models capture the observed intra-urban XCO2 gradients. Further, OCO-3's multi-swath measurements capture about three times as much of the city emissions compared to single-swath overpasses. OCO-3's frequent target and SAM mode observations will pave the way to constrain urban emissions at finer, sub-city scales.",

Intraseasonal variability was weak during the field program, except for a period of suppressed convection in October. Tropical cyclone activity, on the other hand, was strong. Variability at the ship location was characterized by periods of low-level easterly atmospheric flow with embedded westward propagating synoptic-scale atmospheric disturbances, punctuated by periods of strong low-level westerly winds that were both connected to the Asian monsoon westerlies and associated with tropical cyclones. In the most dramatic case, westerlies persisted for days during and after tropical cyclone Jebi had passed to the north of the ship. In these periods, the sea surface temperature was reduced by a couple of degrees by both wind mixing and net surface heat fluxes that were strongly (~200<em>Wm</em><sup>\u22122</sup>) out of the ocean, due to both large latent heat flux and cloud shading associated with widespread deep convection. Underway conductivity-temperature transects showed dramatic cooling and deepening of the ocean mixed layer and erosion of the barrier layer after the passage of Typhoon Mangkhut due to entrainment of cooler water from below. Strong zonal currents observed over at least the upper 400 meters were likely related to the generation and propagation of near-inertial currents.</p></section>",

            "abstractNote": "Reliable detection and observation of vegetation changes are increasingly essential for investigating the dynamic balance of regional ecosystems. The Yellow River Basin (YRB) serves as an ecological barrier in northern China, where vegetation is extremely sensitive to climate change and human activities. However, whether there has been a significant change in the intensity of vegetation dynamics in the YRB during the 21st century and how much anthropogenic disturbances contribute to the change are still poorly documented so far; thus, this work may hold a far-reaching significance for maintaining the eco-balance of northern China and even all of China. In this study, based on the annually and seasonally averaged normalized deviation vegetation index (NDVI), a comprehensive analysis was conducted to detect the trends of vegetation changes derived by NDVI at six different time scales during the period 2000\u20132018 using Theil-Sen statistics, and the Mann-Kendall (M-K) method was employed to test the significance levels of vegetation greening and browning. Subsequently, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land cover data, in situ climatic and meteorological data and socioeconomic and anthropogenic factors were included to explore the driving forces for vegetation change through the GeoDetector method. Our results show that the YRB experienced both significant vegetation greening and browning with great spatial heterogeneity. More than 94% of the regions in the YRB showed vegetation greening trends at average rates of 0.0040\u00a0yr\u22121 in the annually averaged NDVI (NDVIAN) and 0.0053\u00a0yr\u22121 in the growing season averaged NDVI (NDVIGS) during the 21st century; the trend was significant in more than 71% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of the total YRB territory. This phenomenon was mainly detected in the middle reaches of the YRB, where effective land use activities and afforestation played vital roles. There was great seasonal disparity for greening; spring NDVI (NDVISP) and summer NDVI (NDVISU) exhibited the largest greening rates. However, only small parts of the YRB (0.9%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) showed browning trends at average rates of 0.0015\u00a0yr\u22121 in NDVIAN and 0.0021\u00a0yr\u22121 in NDVIGS, mainly located in the Weihe River basin and the lower reaches of the YRB, where the sharp increase in urban and built-up areas contributed substantially to the browning trends. Overall, warming, increasing population and afforestation jointly dominated the significant vegetation greening trends in the YRB.",

Data from the world bank, namely gross domestic product (GDP) and CO2 emissions, were used. BC, SO2, and CO data were obtained from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). The linear correlation coefficient and the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis test were used to determine the relationships. The sequential Mann\u2013Kendall (SQMK) test was further used to study the trends. A correlation coefficient of 0.84, which indicates a strong positive linear correlation, between GDP and CO2 emission was observed. However, the relationship between GDP and CO concentration showed a correlation coefficient of \u22120.05, indicating no linear relationship between the two variables. The EKC hypothesis showed an N-shape for SO2 and CO. Overall, the results of this study indicate that emissions levels are generally correlated with economic growth. Therefore, a stringent regulatory system is needed to curtail the high emissions levels observed in this study, given the devastating impacts of global warming already ravaging the world.",

            "abstractNote": "This research assesses the changes in total water storage (TWS) during the twentieth century and future projections in the Nile River Basin (NRB) via TWSA (TWS anomalies) records from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment), GRACE-FO (Follow-On), data-driven-reanalysis TWSA and a land surface model (LSM), in association with precipitation, temperature records, and standard drought indicators. The analytical approach incorporates the development of 100+ yearlong TWSA records using a probabilistic conditional distribution fitting approach by the GAMLSS (generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape) model. The model performance was tested using standard indicators including coevolution plots, the Nash\u2013Sutcliffe coefficient, cumulative density function, standardized residuals, and uncertainty bounds. All model evaluation results are satisfactory to excellent. The drought and flooding severity/magnitude, duration, and recurrence frequencies were assessed during the studied period. The results showed, (1) The NRB between 2002 to 2020 has witnessed a substantial transition to wetter conditions. Specifically, during the wet season, the NRB received between ~50 Gt./yr. to ~300 Gt./yr. compared to ~30 Gt./yr. to ~70 Gt./yr. of water loss during the dry season. (2) The TWSA reanalysis records between 1901 to 2002 revealed that the NRB had experienced a positive increase in TWS of ~17% during the wet season. Moreover, the TWS storage had witnessed a recovery of ~28% during the dry season. (3) The projected TWSA between 2021 to 2050 unveiled a positive increase in the TWS during the rainy season. While during the dry season, the water storage showed insubstantial TWS changes. Despite these projections, the future storage suggested a reduction between 10 to 30% in TWS. The analysis of drought and flooding frequencies between 1901 to 2050 revealed that the NRB has ~64 dry-years compared to ~86 wet-years. The exceedance probabilities for the normal conditions are between 44 to 52%, relative to a 4% chance of extreme events. The recurrence interval of the normal to moderate wet or dry conditions is ~6 years. These TWSA trajectories call for further water resources planning in the region, especially during flood seasons. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve the TWSA assessment and its associated dynamics for transboundary river basins.",

The anomalies are mid- and short-term precursors of strong earthquakes in California that occurred on July 4 and 5, 2019 (M = 6.4 and M = 7.1). Precursory changes in the lithosphere are analyzed using lineament system characteristics obtained by processing satellite imagery (Terra/Aqua satellites and MODIS instrument), along with variations in the Earth\u2019s surface temperature (the Aqua satellite and the AIRS instrument). Fluctuations in the temperature of the near-surface atmospheric layer are studied to detect atmospheric anomalies during preparation of seismic events, as are fluctuations in the air temperature now at an altitude of 1000 hPa and changes in outgoing longwave radiation recorded by the AIRS instrument on the Aqua satellite. Variations in the ionospheric electron density in the F2-layer maximum are studied with GPS data to reveal ionospheric anomalies during the precursors and occurrence of earthquakes. Joint analysis of anomalies in different geophysical fields, identified via satellite monitoring, allow precursory changes in the lithosphere to be detected a month before strong earthquakes. Precursory changes in the atmosphere and ionosphere can be detected 3\u20136 days and 3\u20135 or 10\u00a0days before earthquakes, respectively.",

            "abstractNote": "Black carbon (BC) aerosols measured simultaneously over a source (Ahmedabad, urban) and background (Gurushikhar, high-altitude) region are analysed. The influence of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), and potential source regions for BC are examined, and compared with model, for the first time. BC mass in Ahmedabad is significantly higher (2 to 5 times) than Gurushikhar. BC mass concentrations in Ahmedabad peak during morning and evening hours when ABL is shallow and anthropogenic emissions are high. In contrast over Gurushikhar BC emissions are higher in afternoon due to a fully evolved ABL and upward transport of pollutants from the valley/foothills during winter when Gurushikhar is within ABL. During other seasons ABL is higher and diurnal variation is suppressed. BCmax over Gurushikhar is close to BCmin over Ahmedabad, which occurs during afternoon hours when ABL is fully evolved and anthropogenic sources are negligible over Ahmedabad while emissions get transported from foothills surrounding Gurushikhar. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis reveals that probable source regions for BC in these two locations are distinctly different, especially, during postmonsoon and winter, long range transport from northwestern India and the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) are the probable source regions (agricultural waste and biomass burning) to the BC over the high-altitude location. Regional transport of BC emitted from urban areas of Ahmedabad to high-altitude Gurushikhar is evident in premonsoon from PSCF analysis. BC mass concentrations simulated by 2 models - MERRA-2 (fine resolution) and ECHAM6 (coarse resolution) are significantly underestimated over the source region Ahmedabad though the models capture the seasonal cycle of winter high and monsoon low. The models simulate BC mass over the background region Gurushikhar well. The magnitude of BC mass concentrations simulated by both models over Ahmedabad and Gurushikar are quite similar. This observation-model comparative analysis reveals that anthropogenic aerosol emissions, especially BC and its long range transport are inadequately represented in models, in particular over the source regions strongly suggesting that improvements in emission inventories of aerosol sources as well as inclusion of missing aerosol source categories are needed. Such quantitative evaluation of BC aerosols over a source and a background region due to the influence of ABL, and potential source regions are hitherto unavailable over tropics which can be used to improve the representation of aerosols in models and thereby estimates of radiative and climate effects due to aerosols.",

            "abstractNote": "Ground and satellite measurements of particulate pollution play an important role in determining the particulate pollutant-Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) relationship. The daily observed PM10 and PM2.5 concentration varied from 11\u2013757 \u03bcg/m3 and 8\u2013630 \u03bcg/m3 with the mean concentrations of 137 \u00b1 119 \u03bcg/m3 and 86 \u00b1 90 \u03bcg/m3, respectively. The long-term mean annual PM10 and PM2.5 levels are several times higher than the WHO permissible limits. The 1377 satellite-derived AOD observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, ground-based particulate matter (PM) and meteorological observations from 2013\u20132017 were analysed to develop two-variate linear model (TVM) (AOD versus PM10 or PM2.5) and multi-variate regression models (MVMs) (AOD + meteorological parameters versus PM10 or PM2.5) for estimation of the ground level PM10 and PM2.5 in the Kashmir Himalaya, India. The model evaluation showed that the PM predication estimates are significant at 99% confidence level for all the models. The TVM predicts daily PM10 concentration better than PM2.5 explaining 82% and 74% variance in the observed data, respectively. By adding meteorological data to the regression analysis, there is an improvement of 5% and 11% in R2 for PM10 and PM2.5 estimates which inter alia reduced the RMSE by 11.8% and 20.47%, respectively. Estimation of the particulate pollution, utilising satellite-based AOD, observed PM and meteorology, would encourage satellite-based air quality monitoring in the data-scarce Himalaya. However, it is suggested that more studies are required to improve the operational prediction of PM pollution by incorporating satellite observations of other pollutants, and processes in the model using advanced approaches.",

Experiments are performed using the RTTOV-SCATT radiative transfer model for three cyclone events (Hudhud (2014), Vardah (2016), and Kyant (2016)) for 19\u202fV, 23\u202fV, 37\u202fV, 89\u202fV, 166\u202fV, 183\u00b13, and 183\u00b17\u202fV channels. Results show that observed and simulated brightness temperatures (Tb) agree well for low-frequency channels (<89\u202fGHz). However, significant discrepancies do exist when simulating low Tb at high frequency channels. Therefore, a set of 26 simulations is considered using snow particle shapes from single scattering property databases. A new methodology is devised in order to compare the 26 simulations with observations; taking into account the uncertainties on hydrometeor radiative properties. Results reveal that model simulations are characterized by an underestimation of occurrences within several Tb ranges (~200\u2013300\u202fK). The probability distribution function (PDF) of normalized observed-minus first guess is close to a Gaussian shape after applying a dedicated model of observation errors. The potential to integrate the GMI sensor data within a WRF data assimilation system is thus demonstrated.",

            "abstractNote": "Satellite-based methods have been widely used to identify the critical phenophases of terrestrial vegetation and detect responses of phenophases to climate change. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of satellite-based methods for identifying the spatial and temporal changes of phenophases based on site-based phenophase observations. This study used the ground observations of leaf unfolding date (LUD) of woody and herbaceous plants over 31 sites in China to evaluate the accuracy of LUDs modeled by eight satellite-based methods using Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index product. Our results showed an observed 2.62 and 2.45\u00a0days advance of LUD over the spatial scale with an increased mean annual temperature of 1\u00a0\u00b0C over the forest and grassland ecosystems respectively, but almost all eight methods underestimated the advance rates. In addition, the trends for the observed LUD varied from site to site, and the eight methods showed the poor performance in capturing the long-term trends, mostly because low temporal resolution of satellite data. Most methods tended to overestimate the trend of LUD over more than 40% forest sites. Our results highlight that there is a need for further improvements in the methods and satellite datasets used for identifying LUD.",

            "abstractNote": "The Kuroshio Current has its origin in the northwestern Pacific, flowing northward to the east of Taiwan and the northern part of Luzon Island. As the Kuroshio Current flows northward, it quasi-periodically intrudes (hereafter referred to as Kuroshio intrusion (KI)) into the northern South China Sea (SCS) basin through the Luzon Strait. Despite the complex generation mechanisms of KI, the purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the effects of KI through the Luzon Strait on the regional atmospheric and weather variations. Long-term multiple satellite observations, including absolute dynamic topography, absolute geostrophic currents, sea surface winds by ASCAT, multi-scale ultra-high resolution sea surface temperature (MURSST) level-four analysis, and research-quality three-hourly TRMM multi-satellite precipitation analysis (TMPA), was used to systematically examine the aforementioned scientific problem. Analysis indicates that the KI is interlinked with the consequential anomalous precipitation off southwestern Taiwan. This anomalous precipitation would lead to ~560 million tons of freshwater influx during each KI event. Subsequently, independent moisture budget analysis suggests that moisture, mainly from vertical advection, is the possible source of the precipitation anomaly. Additionally, a bulk formula analysis was applied to understand how KI can trigger the precipitation anomaly through vertical advection of moisture without causing an evident change in the low-level flows. These new research findings might reconcile the divisiveness on why winds are not showing a synchronous response during the KI and consequential anomalous precipitation events.",

However, the IAV of the nationwide annual NPP in China and the impacts of distinct climatic drivers are not well addressed. In this study, we investigated regional contributions to the IAV of the nationwide NPP and quantified the contributions of nine climatic drivers in different regions using the NPP estimated by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford (CASA) model from 1982 to 2018. Our results showed that the simulated NPP exhibited an increasing trend of 15.2 Tg C yr-1 at the national scale. The nationwide NPP also showed large IAV ranging from \u200d-0.29 to 0.22 Pg C with the mean absolute NPP IAV showing a descending gradient from southeastern to northwestern China. Our estimates and thirteen terrestrial biosphere models verified that humid region accounted for the largest contribution (62%) to this large IAV. Attribution analyses indicated that normal and high precipitation amount (nP, HP), as well as high temperature days (HT) and daily temperature range (DTR) exerted the largest contributions to the national NPP IAV. Regional analyses indicated that DTR and HP were the major climatic drivers to NPP IAV in humid region, whereas NPP IAV in water-limited regions (i.e., semi-humid, semi-arid, and arid regions) were tightly associated with nP, HP, and HT. DTR and nP exerted the largest contributions to NPP IAV in the Tibetan Plateau. However, more attention should be paid to the negative impacts of low temperature events and potential drought on NPP IAV in humid region and that of HT in water-limited regions. This study emphasized the dominant role of humid region in controlling the national NPP IAV and the different ecosystem responses to diverse climatic drivers, and therefore can be valuable for adaptive management of ecosystems when facing climate change.",

To investigate the critical hydrometeorological processes during drought, we use a land surface model, Noah-MP, to simulate water availability and investigate the causes of the record drought. We conduct a series of experiments with runoff schemes, vegetation phenology, and plant rooting depth. Observation-based terrestrial water storage, evapotranspiration, runoff, and leaf area index are used to compare with results from the model. Overall, the results suggest that using different parameterizations can influence the modeled water availability, especially during drought. The drought-induced vegetation responses not only interact with water availability but also affect the ground temperature. Our evaluation shows that Noah-MP with a groundwater scheme produces a better temporal relationship in terrestrial water storage compared with observations. Leaf area index from dynamic vegetation is better simulated in wet years than dry years. Reduction of positive biases in runoff and reduction of negative biases in evapotranspiration are found in simulations with groundwater, dynamic vegetation, and deeper rooting zone depth. Multi-parameterization experiments show the uncertainties of drought monitoring and provide a mechanistic understanding of disparities in dry anomalies.</p></section>",

Tropical cyclones affect the life of millions of people around the globe. INSAT-3D is the second dedicated meteorological satellite which was launched on July 26, 2013, with two meteorological payloads: Imager and Sounder. It is placed at 83\u00a0\u00b0E over the equator in the geostationary orbit. Receiving, processing and dissemination of imageries and derived products from INSAT-3D are taken care by INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS), which is operational at National Meteorological Satellite Centre, India Meteorological Department, New Delhi. Currently, three satellite-derived rain estimates are generated at IMDPS, New Delhi: Qualitative Precipitation Estimate (QPE), Hydro-Estimator (HE) and INSAT Multi-Spectral Rain Estimate (IMSRA). In this study, the performance of HE and IMSRA over very severe cyclonic storm Vardah and severe cyclonic storm Mora has been evaluated with respect to GPM (IMERG). The statistical and skill score analysis is performed both over half-hourly scale with respect to various stages of cyclone genesis, intensification and weakening and on the daily scale. At the instantaneous time during half-hourly analysis, IMSRA has displayed better relation and skill with GPM (IMERG). However, during daily accumulated analysis, it is found that IMSRA tends to underestimate after a specific value. On a daily scale, HE has exhibited better skill with IMSRA.",

In this article, we report for the first time the impact of these two events on the middle atmospheric nitric oxide (NO) abundance. The study is based on measurements obtained during two dedicated observation campaigns, using the Sub-Millimetre Radiometer (SMR) aboard the Odin satellite, measuring NO globally since 2003. The SSW of February 2018 was similar to other, more dynamically quiet, Arctic winters in term of NO downward transport from the upper mesosphere-lower thermosphere to lower altitudes (referred to as energetic particle precipitation indirect effect EPP-IE). On the contrary, the event of January 2019 led to one of the strongest EPP-IE cases observed within the Odin operational period. Important positive NO anomalies were indeed observed in the lower mesosphere-upper stratosphere during the three months following the SSW onset, corresponding to NO volume mixing ratios more than 50 times higher than the climatological values. These different consequences on the middle atmospheric composition are explained by very different dynamical characteristics of these two SSW events.",

            "abstractNote": "A long-term drift in polar motion (PM) has been observed for more than a century, and Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) has been understood as an important cause. However, observed PM includes contributions from other sources, including contemporary climate change and perhaps others associated with Earth\u2019s interior dynamics. It has been difficult to separate these effects, because there is considerable scatter among GIA models concerning predicted PM rates. Here we develop a new method to estimate GIA PM using data from the GRACE mission. Changes in GRACE degree 2, order 1 spherical harmonic coefficients are due both to GIA and contemporary surface mass load changes. We estimate the surface mass load contribution to degree 2, order 1 coefficients using GRACE data, relying on higher-degree GRACE coefficients that are dominantly affected by surface loads. Then the GIA PM trend is obtained from the difference between observed PM trend (which includes effects from GIA and surface mass loads) and the estimated PM trend mostly associated with surface mass loads. A previous estimate of the GIA PM trend from PM observations for the period 1900\u20131978 is toward 79.90\u00b0 W at a speed of 3.53 mas/year (10.91\u00a0cm/year). Our new estimate for the GIA trend is in a direction of 61.77\u00b0 W at a speed of 2.18 mas/year (6.74\u00a0cm/year), similar to the observed PM trend during the early twentieth century. This is consistent with the view that the early twentieth-century trend was dominated by GIA and that more recently there is an increasing contribution from contemporary surface mass load redistribution associated with climate change. Our GIA PM also agrees with the linear mean pole during 1900\u20132017. Contributions from other solid Earth process such as mantle convection would also produce a linear trend in PM and could be included in our GIA estimate.",

The results suggest that the three IMERG products can well reproduce the spatial patterns of precipitation, but exhibit a gradual decrease in the accuracy from the southeast to the northwest of China. Overall, the three runs show better performances in the eastern humid basins than the western arid basins. Compared to the early and late runs, the final run shows an improvement in the performance of precipitation estimation in terms of correlation coefficient, Kling\u2013Gupta Efficiency and root mean square error at both daily and monthly scales. The three runs show similar daily precipitation detection capability over China. The biases of the three runs show a significantly positive (p &lt; 0.01) correlation with elevation, with higher accuracy observed with an increase in elevation. However, the categorical metrics exhibit low levels of dependency on elevation, except for the probability of detection. Over China and major river basins, the three products underestimate the frequency of no/tiny rain events (P &lt; 0.1 mm/day) but overestimate the frequency of light rain events (0.1 \u2264 P &lt; 10 mm/day). The three products converge with ground-based observation with regard to the frequency of rainstorm (P \u2265 50 mm/day) in the southern part of China. The revealed uncertainties associated with the IMERG products suggests that sustaining efforts are needed to improve their retrieval algorithms in the future.",

            "abstractNote": "Drought is an affliction for a region that primarily depends on agriculture as economic activity. Commonly monitoring and characterizing of drought is performed by only analyzing the meteorological aspect, assuming precipitation as the primary source of water. However, in riverine Bangladesh, this can lead to an erroneous conclusion, as there is a multitude of available water sources. Consequently, in this study, vegetation condition (Standard Vegetation Index), soil moisture (Soil Moisture Index), and precipitation (Standard Precipitation Index) are separately investigated from 2003 to 2019, in the Northwestern Teesta floodplain. Subsequently, statistical regression analysis is performed to determine the relationships between different aspects of drought. In addition, information obtained from field visits and expert opinions has also been assimilated. Analysis of vegetation and soil moisture condition presents a progressively improving scenario. However, SPI shows an incessant decline in meteorological drought conditions, especially after 2007. Evidently, regression analysis does not provide any indication of an interrelationship between the studied agricultural and meteorological parameters. Presumably, this absence is instigated because the study area is highly irrigated as the groundwater table is suitably near the surface and the existence of nearby Teesta river allows for the utilization of surface water. Moreover, the cropping pattern is shifting toward crops that require much less water and to places where soil moisture is scarce. Thus, this study addresses the gap in knowledge regarding the nature of agricultural drought and the dynamics of different aspects of drought which will be invaluable for the water management and agricultural policy in the study area as well as other regions with a similar backdrop.",

On January 23 in Wuhan, and later in all other cities of the country, there were taken measures to control the spread of the virus through quarantine measures. This article focused on East China and attempted to assess comprehensively the environmental impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study analyzed satellite observational data of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the period before the outbreak of the epidemic and during the implementation of preventive measures and control of COVID-19, as well as compared it with the data obtained in the same period of 2019. The results of the analysis showed that the COVID-19 lockdown improved air quality in the short term, but as soon as coal consumption at power plants and refineries returned to normal levels due to the resumption of their work, pollution levels returned to their previous level. The levels of CO and NO2 showed the most significant decrease (20 and 30%), since they were mainly associated with a decrease in economic growth and transport restrictions that led to a change in energy consumption and a reduction in emissions. This study can complement the scientific community and environmental protection policy makers, not only to assess the impact of outbreak on air quality, but also for its effectiveness as a simple alternative program of action to improve air quality.",

To investigate study region with more details, the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain was divided into three and four zones, respectively. This work utilized comprehensive satellite-based air quality data using NASA\u2019s Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) model. The retrieved total AOD data exhibited relatively lower average values in the Bahraini zones in comparison with the Eastern KSA during the study period. The monthly total AOD values in Bahraini zones were in the range of 0.20 and 0.87, while they were in the range of 0.23 and 0.91 in KSA zones. The AOD values were positively correlated with ambient air temperature (r\u2009=\u20090.43), while they were negatively correlated with relative humidity (r\u2009=\u20090.59) in Bahrain. Seasonal wind rose diagrams for Bahrain and monthly synoptic maps of (20\u201340\u00b0N, 40\u201360\u00b0E) West Asia region demonstrates that dominant wind direction is from NNW to Bahrain. The data assimilation algorithms in MERRA-2 showed that the major aerosol species that contributed to total AOD were as follows: mineral dust (68\u201374%), sulfate (17\u201320%), organic carbon (4\u20135%), sea salt (3\u20135%) and black carbon (2%). Monthly, seasonal and annual variations of speciated AOD values assisted in understanding aerosols loading over study area.",

A positive matrix factorization (PMF) model identified six potential emission sources impacting the study area. The PMF model solution yielded the following source concentration profiles: (i) combustion; (ii) fresh sea salt; (iii) aged sea salt; (iv) secondary sulfate; (v) shipping emissions; and (vi) dust. Based on these results, concentration-weighted trajectory maps were developed to identify sources contributing to the PMF factors. Monthly mean precipitation pH values ranged from 4.98 to 5.58, being positively related to crustal species and negatively related to SO42&minus;. Sea salt dominated wet deposition volume-weighted concentrations year-round without much variability in its mass fraction in contrast to stronger seasonal changes in PM2.5 composition where fresh sea salt was far less influential. The highest mean annual deposition fluxes were attributed to Cl&minus;, NO3&minus;, SO42&minus;, and Na+ between April and October. Nitrate is strongly correlated with dust constituents (unlike sea salt) in precipitation samples, indicative of efficient partitioning to dust. Interrelationships between precipitation chemistry and aerosol species based on long-term surface data provide insight into aerosol&ndash;cloud&ndash;precipitation interactions.",

This study constitutes the first systematic application of the WRF&ndash;Chem online-based approach to a specific Etna volcanic eruption, with possible effects involving the whole Mediterranean area. In this context, the attention has been focused on the eruption event, recorded from 3&ndash;7 December 2015, which led to the closure of the nearby Catania International Airport. Quantitative meteorological forecasts, analyses of Etna volcanic ash transport, and estimates of the ash ground deposition have been performed. In order to test the performance of the proposed approach, the model outputs have been compared with data provided by satellite sensors and Doppler radars. As a result, it emerges that, as far as the selected eruption event is concerned, the WRF&ndash;Chem model reasonably reproduces the distribution of SO2 and of volcanic ash. In addition, this modeling system may provide valuable support both to airport management and to local stakeholders including public administrations.",

            "abstractNote": "Extreme dust episodes have been noticeably increasing in recent years. Dust burden during such events imparts several threats to the environment and human health. Therefore, forecast of such extreme events becomes of utmost importance to minimise the adverse impact on various socio-economy sectors. In the present study model experiments have been carried out for the simulation of an extreme dust episode that emanated over the western Indian region that coupled with previously transported dust from the West Asia region and resulted in the highly degraded air quality over the Indian region. For this purpose four ensemble members, using Weather Research and Forecasting model fully coupled with chemistry (WRF-CHEM), have been generated for identical model configuration but for the perturbed initial conditions. Model performance has been evaluated with respect to the available ground based measurements from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA2) data sets using standard statistical measures. Ensemble spread is noted amongst the four ensemble members generated based on 4 varying initial conditions, therefore it is suggested to use ensemble mean forecast for the dust storm monitoring and analysis. It is revealed from the analysis based on the categorical validation scheme that the WRF-CHEM simulated dust load is able to capture the locational accuracy with respect to the reanalysis/observational data sets over Indian subcontinent fairly well with 0% false alarm ratio, 78\u201392% probability of detection and 79\u201390% accuracy. It is noted that thick blanket of dust load enveloped Northern part of India subsequent to the dust storm which resulted in substantially dropped ground reaching solar radiation (~100\u2013150\u00a0W/m2) and a consequential reduction in the surface temperature (~2\u00a0\u00b0C). Further to this enhanced temperature in association with reduced relative humidity from 800 to 600\u00a0hPa has also been noted in response to the enhanced dust loading in the model simulations. Results obtained in the present study suggests that WRF-CHEM is able to simulate both the direct and semi-direct effects of dust aerosols reasonably well. Present work has implications for improved prediction skills of WRF-CHEM in simulating extreme dust episodes and investigating the impact of dust aerosols on weather and climate.",

This has resulted in lockdown under different phases in many nations, including India, around the globe. In the present study, we report the impact of aerosols on surface ozone in the context of pre-lockdown (01st - 24th March 2020 (PLD)), lockdown phase1 (25th March to 14th April 2020 (LDP1)), and lockdown phase 2 (15th April to 03rd May 2020 (LDP2)) on clear days at a semi-arid site, Anantapur in southern India using both in situ observations and model simulations. Collocated measurements of surface ozone (O3), aerosol optical depth (AOD), black carbon mass concentration (BC), total columnar ozone (TCO), solar radiation (SR), and ultraviolet radiation (UV-A) data were collected using an Ozone analyzer, MICROTOPS sunphotometer, Ozonometer, Aethalometer, and net radiometer during the study period. The diurnal variations of O3 and BC exhibited an opposite trend during three phases. The concentrations of ozone were ~10.7% higher during LDP1 (44.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0ppbv) than the PLD (40.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0\u00a0ppbv), which mainly due to an unprecedented reduction in NOx emissions leading to a lower O3 titration by NO. The prominent increase in the surface zone during LDP1 is reasonably consistent with the observed photolysis frequencies (j (O1D)) through Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible (TUV) model. The results show that a pronounced spectral and temporal variability in the AOD during three lockdown phases is mainly due to distinct aerosol sources. The increase in AOD during LDP2 due to long-range transport can bring large amounts of mineral dust and smoke aerosols from the west Asian region and central India, and which is reasonably consistent with the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) air mass back trajectories and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire counts analysis over the measurement location. Overall, a drastic reduction in BC concentration (~8.4%) and AOD (10.8%) were observed in the semi-arid area during LDP1 with correspondence to PLD. The columnar aerosol size distributions retrieved from the spectral AODs followed power-law plus unimodal during three phases. The absorption angstrom exponent (AAE) analysis reveals a predominant contribution to the BC from biomass burning activities during the lockdown period over the measurement location.",

Two aerosol formation pathways were identified during the EP, the first being the condensation of semi- and intermediate volatility oxidation products of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs) under stagnant synoptic flow conditions, high temperatures and afternoon sea-breeze circulation. While this first pathway was prevalent, the most abundant organic aerosol factor was less oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol or LO-OOA. The second formation pathway occurred during a period of more persistent (synoptic) on-shore flow transporting more aged aerosol which consisted of an internal mixture of more oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and sulfate. It was estimated that 35% of the sulfate observed during the mature period (an average of about 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m\u22123) originated from oceanic dimethyl sulfide (DMS) emissions. These two formation pathways helped elucidate the sources of fine particle pollution, highlighted the interaction between human emissions and natural DMS emission, and will help our understanding of pollution affecting other urban areas adjacent to large bodies of water during hot and stagnant periods.",

Using satellite precipitation and reanalysis data, we examined the influence of along-track large-scale environmental conditions on inner-core rainfall strength (RS) and total rainfall area (RA) for Atlantic TCs during the TC season (July to November) from 1998 to 2019. Factor analysis revealed three major factors associated with variations in RS and RA: large-scale low- and high-pressure systems (F1), environmental flows, sea surface temperature, and humidity (F2), and maximum wind speed of TCs (F3). Results from our study indicate that RS increases with an increase in the inherent primary circulation of TCs (i.e., F3), but is less affected by large-scale environmental conditions (i.e., F1 and F2), whereas RA is primarily influenced by large-scale low- and high-pressure systems (i.e., F1) over the entire North Atlantic and partially influenced by environmental flows, sea surface temperature, humidity, and maximum wind speed (i.e., F2 and F3). A multi-variable regression model based on the three factors accounted for the variations of RS and RA across the entire basin. In addition, regional distributions of mean RS and RA from the model significantly resembled those from observations. Therefore, our study suggests that large-scale environmental conditions over the North Atlantic are important predictors for TC rainfall forecasts, particularly regarding RA.</p></section>",

            "abstractNote": "The launch of GRACE satellites has provided a new avenue for studying the terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) with unprecedented accuracy. However, the coarse spatial resolution greatly limits its application in hydrology researches on local scales. To overcome this limitation, this study develops a machine learning-based fusion model to obtain high-resolution (0.25&deg;) groundwater level anomalies (GWLA) by integrating GRACE observations in the North China Plain. Specifically, the fusion model consists of three modules, namely the downscaling module, the data fusion module, and the prediction module, respectively. In terms of the downscaling module, the GRACE-Noah model outperforms traditional data-driven models (multiple linear regression and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)) with the correlation coefficient (CC) values from 0.24 to 0.78. With respect to the data fusion module, the groundwater level from 12 monitoring wells is incorporated with climate variables (precipitation, runoff, and evapotranspiration) using the GBDT algorithm, achieving satisfactory performance (mean values: CC: 0.97, RMSE: 1.10 m, and MAE: 0.87 m). By merging the downscaled TWSA and fused groundwater level based on the GBDT algorithm, the prediction module can predict the water level in specified pixels. The predicted groundwater level is validated against 6 in-situ groundwater level data sets in the study area. Compare to the downscaling module, there is a significant improvement in terms of CC metrics, on average, from 0.43 to 0.71. This study provides a feasible and accurate fusion model for downscaling GRACE observations and predicting groundwater level with improved accuracy.",

Diffuse recharge is also the process through which climate and climate change directly affect groundwater. In this study, we evaluated diffuse recharge over the conterminous U.S. simulated by a suite of land surface models (LSMs) that were forced using a common set of meteorological input data. Simulated annual recharge exhibited spatial patterns that were similar among the LSMs, with the highest values in the eastern U.S. and Pacific Northwest. However, the magnitudes of annual recharge varied significantly among the models and were associated with differences in simulated ET, runoff and snow. Evaluation against two independent datasets did not answer the question of whether the ensemble mean performs the best, due to inconsistency between those datasets. The amplitude and timing of seasonal maximum recharge differed among the models, influenced strongly by model physics governing deep soil moisture drainage rates and, in cold regions, snowmelt. Evaluation using <em>in situ</em> soil moisture observations suggested that true recharge peaks 1-3 months later than simulated recharge, indicating systematic biases in simulating deep soil moisture. However, recharge from lateral flows and through preferential flows cannot be inferred from soil moisture data, and the seasonal cycle of simulated groundwater storage actually compared well with <em>in situ</em> groundwater observations. Long-term trends in recharge were not consistently correlated with either precipitation trends or temperature trends. This study highlights the need to employ dynamic flow models in LSMs, among other improvements, to enable more accurate simulation of recharge.</p></section>",

            "abstractNote": "The Chatham Rise supports some of New Zealand's most economically valuable commercial fish stocks, fuelled by the highly productive waters of the Subtropical Frontal Zone (STFZ). Climate change-related shifts in phytoplankton community structure and function are predicted and may affect Chatham Rise productivity and deep-sea carbon sequestration by the biological carbon pump. However, little is known about how two major phytoplankton groups, diatoms and coccolithophores, will respond, since the seasonality of their productivity and export fluxes to the seafloor are not well known in the SW Pacific sector. This study is the first to report on the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton species fluxes in the STFZ, using a 12-month sediment trap record (1996\u20131997) on the northern (subtropical-influenced) and southern (subantarctic-influenced) flanks of the Chatham Rise. Diatom and coccolith flux assemblages were characterised and compared with biogeochemical fluxes from the same sites over the same time-frame. Northern phytoplankton flux composition was typical of the subtropics, with most particulate organic carbon (POC) and biogenic silica export associated with diatom fluxes. Fluxes to the northern trap were largely composed of coastal and benthic diatom taxa, reinforcing previous interpretations suggesting lateral advection and sediment resuspension along and across the Chatham Rise slope, influenced also by the Wairarapa Eddy. At the southern site, phytoplankton fluxes were on average an order of magnitude higher than at the northern site and comprised a combination of subantarctic and frontal zone diatom taxa. The majority of the annual diatom flux in the southern trap occurred during a spring Pseudo-nitzschia \u201cpulse\u201d associated with high biogenic silica and POC fluxes, which are inferred to be from subsurface chlorophyll maxima. High coccolith flux at the southern STFZ site was consistent with ecosystem processes observed from other subantarctic export regimes. Phytoplankton successions inferred from the sediment trap records suggest that coccolithophores precede diatoms in spring, which is contrary to expectations from classical studies where the opposite temporal trend is suggested. While maximum diatom species flux co-occurred with peak POC flux at both sites in spring, the estimated contribution of organic carbon associated with diatoms to POC flux was negligible (<0.05%). Estimated coccolithophore POC flux was also low, suggesting that either other phytoplankton groups and/or zooplankton-mediated processes (e.g. fecal pellet fluxes) must contribute more substantially to POC export in the STFZ. Our findings provide new insights into phytoplankton export flux pathways to the seafloor in the Chatham Rise region, with implications for regional biogeochemistry, paleoceanographic and export modelling studies.",

            "abstractNote": "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) instruments provide a powerful tool to investigate spatiotemporal variations in regional-scale terrestrial water storage based on the solid Earth's elastic response to hydrologic loading signals. Here, we implemented an independent component analysis-based inversion method to investigate water storage changes and hydrometeorological extremes (e.g., heavy precipitation and droughts) in Yunnan. Our time-varying inversion allows us to reproduce the spatiotemporal evolution of terrestrial water storage changes. Three independent components (ICs) were chosen in our time-varying inversion model. The first two ICs contribute to 96.9% and 2.1% of data variance, respectively, and reveal annual water storage changes at different temporal scales. The third IC slightly explains the network time series and possibly correlates with the nonlinear water changes. The averaged GNSS, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) based multi-annual seasonal water changes have good consistency in their spatiotemporal signatures. All datasets suggest a gradually increasing trend in seasonal water storage variations from northeast to southwest Yunnan. The peak annual amplitudes of ~355\u00a0mm in the GNSS-inferred water estimates are larger than those of ~167\u2013226\u00a0mm derived from the GLDAS and GRACE models. Hydrometeorological extremes are tracked in the various water time series, and GNSS-derived water deficits contribute to hydrological drought characterization. We also find good agreement between daily precipitation anomalies, GNSS-, and GLDAS-based water changes during the 2015 winter rainstorm. Our results demonstrate that a continuously operating GNSS network is a complementary tool to remotely measure terrestrial water storage changes and to provide valuable insights into operational hydrological monitoring.",

The available satellite soil moisture data products are too coarse and unable to cater for this resolution requirement. Downscaling coarse spatial resolution satellite soil moisture retrievals is a feasible option to meet the required level of spatial resolution for those applications. The main focus of this study is to compare two soil thermal inertia-based downscaling models, built by using long-term time records of (i) point scale in-situ data and, (ii) 25 km resolution Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) land surface model outputs. The developed models were tested over Goulburn River catchment in the Upper Hunter Region of NSW, Australia to downscale Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) 36 km radiometric products into 1 km resolution.The downscaled SMAP products from both models produced encouraging results with unbiased root mean square errors (ubRMSEs) of 0.07 - 0.10 cm3/cm3, against in-situ field data, and an average ubRMSEs of 0.07 cm3/cm3 when compared to the National Airborne Field Experiment 2005 (NAFE'05) soil moisture retrievals. Both models showed promising results over semi-arid regions in estimating soil moisture at a high spatial resolution, but with their own strengths and weaknesses. The findings here provide useful insights on the robustness of the soil thermal inertia relationship across scales and the effects of the model resolution to the downscaled soil moisture estimates. The approach demonstrated encouraging results over semi-arid regions in estimating soil moisture at a high spatial resolution.",

            "abstractNote": "On March 12th, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The collective impact of environmental and ecosystem factors, as well as biodiversity, on the spread of COVID-19 and its mortality evolution remain empirically unknown, particularly in regions with a wide ecosystem range. The aim of our study is to assess how those factors impact on the COVID-19 spread and mortality by country. This study compiled a global database merging WHO daily case reports (of 218 countries) with other publicly available measures from January 21st to May 18th, 2020. We applied spatio-temporal models to identify the influence of biodiversity, temperature, and precipitation and fitted generalized linear mixed models to identify the effects of environmental variables. Additionally, we used count time series to characterize the association between COVID-19 spread and air quality factors. All analyses are adjusted by social demographic, country-income level, and government policy intervention confounders, among 160 countries, globally. Our results reveal a statistically meaningful association between COVID-19 infection and several factors of interest at country and city levels such as the national biodiversity index, air quality, and pollutants elements (PM10, PM2.5 and O3). Particularly, there is a significant relationship of loss of biodiversity, high level of air pollutants, and diminished air quality with COVID-19 infection spread and mortality. Our findings provide an empirical foundation for future studies on the relationship between air quality variables, a country\u2019s biodiversity, and COVID-19 transmission and mortality. The significant relationships measured in this study can be valuable when governments plan environmental and health policies, as alternative strategy to respond to new COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent future crises., \n          \n            Image 1\n            \n          \n        , \n          \n            \n              \u2022\n              Meaningful association between COVID-19 infection and national biodiversity index, air quality, and pollutant elements.\n            \n            \n              \u2022\n              Analysis of factors of interest at country and city levels.\n            \n            \n              \u2022\n              Adjusted confounders are social demographics, country-income level, and government policy intervention effects.\n            \n            \n              \u2022\n              Significant relationship of loss of biodiversity, high level of air pollutants, and diminished air quality with COVID-19 infection spread and mortality.\n            \n          \n        , Main findings: Our results reveal a relationship between COVID-19 transmission and mortality and loss of biodiversity, high level of air pollutants, and diminished air quality at country and city levels.",

            "abstractNote": "Heatwaves pose a serious threat to human health worldwide but remain poorly documented over Africa. This study uses mainly the ERA5 dataset to investigate their large-scale drivers over the Sahel region during boreal spring, with a focus on the role of tropical modes of variability including the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the equatorial Rossby and Kelvin waves. Heatwaves were defined from daily minimum and maximum temperatures using a methodology that retains only intraseasonal scale events of large spatial extent. The results show that tropical modes have a large influence on the occurrence of Sahelian heatwaves, and, to a lesser extent, on their intensity. Depending on their convective phase, they can either increase or inhibit heatwave occurrence, with the MJO being the most important of the investigated drivers. A certain sensitivity to the geographic location and the diurnal cycle is observed, with nighttime heatwaves more impacted by the modes over the eastern Sahel and daytime heatwaves more affected over the western Sahel. The examination of the physical mechanisms shows that the modulation is made possible through the perturbation of regional circulation. Tropical modes thus exert a control on moisture and the subsequent longwave radiation, as well as on the advection of hot air. A detailed case study of a major event, which took place in April 2003, further supports these findings. Given the potential predictability offered by tropical modes at the intraseasonal scale, this study has key implications for heatwave risk management in the Sahel.",

            "abstractNote": "Compared with the limited capability of ground-level monitoring, remote sensing provides useful image data at a moderate or high spatial or temporal resolution with global coverage for monitoring of air pollutants, e.g., aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the MODIS for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical columns for ground-level NO2 concentration. However, the extensive nonrandom missingness of OMI-NO2 data (e.g., an approximate per-pixel missing proportion of 59% for mainland China in 2015) due to cloud contamination or high reflectance limits applicability of these data in estimation of ground-level NO2. This paper proposes the use of a full residual deep learning method to impute missing satellite-borne NO2 data (OMI-NO2) and to estimate (map) ground-level NO2 with uncertainty (coefficient of variation) at a high spatial (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 km2) and temporal (daily) resolution. For the large study region (mainland China except Hainan Province), the presented method achieved robust performance with a stable learning efficiency (mean test R2: 0.98 with a small standard deviation of 0.01; mean test RMSE: 0.42\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015 molecules/cm2) for imputation of OMI-NO2. In the model, the coordinates and elevation were used to capture the spatial variability of the OMI-NO2 columns, and fused meteorological grid data and planetary boundary layer height and ozone data from GEOS-FP were used to capture spatiotemporal variability of OMI-NO2. The evaluation with ground in situ NO2 measurements showed considerable contribution of the complete (raw observed and imputed) OMI-NO2 columns, meteorology and traffic variables to inference of ground-level NO2 (test R2: 0.82; test RMSE: 8.80\u00a0\u03bcg/m3). The complete grids of OMI-NO2 columns showed natural and smooth spatial transitions between the raw observed and imputed values. The surfaces of predicted NO2 concentration not only showed consistent distributions with OMI-NO2 at a regional and temporal scale, but also presented local spatial gradients of ground-level NO2. OMI-NO2 can be downscaled and imputed to be used as an important predictor to improve the estimation of high-resolution ground-level NO2. The reliable estimates of ground-level NO2 concentration with uncertainty can reduce the bias in estimates of NO2 exposure and subsequently evaluations of its health effects.",

Mapping radon time dependent concentration at the relaxation depth in a selected area, provide transport direction in a seismically high-risk region. Nuclear track methodology is employed to determine main gradient vector for radon transport. Applying the gradient definition, a \u201cradon rose\u201d graph is constructed from which prone area can be promptly identified. Results show that short time interval, Rn-transport direction may change unpredictably, however, the length of each \"spoke\" around the circle provides information on the soil Rn-gas probable shifts towards or from a direction per time interval. The new graph is a novelty and provide improved approach for environmental protection and radon dosimetry.",

With passive microwave constellations, apersistingchallenge isthelimitedsampling, whichimpactsapplications such as hydrological modeling.This study presents a framework to examine theimpact ofthe GlobalPrecipitationMeasurement(GPM)orbital sampling onstreamflowsimulations. Orbital data fromtheGPM Dual Precipitation Radar (DPR) 2A-Kuis usedwithin the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to derive ensembles of runoff simulations.Ensembles of synthetic precipitation fieldsaregeneratedat different sampling intervalswhich are representative of GPM orbital data productswiththe SatelliteRainfall Error Model (SREM-2D)over theHirakudcatchment in the Indiansubcontinentover aperiodof two years (2015-2016).The NOAA-NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC) morphing technique (CMORPH) satellite-based gridded rainfall product is considered as the reference rainfall for our study. Sampling uncertaintyin orbital precipitation dataisshownto amplify in streamflow simulations. The statistical analysisindicatesthat increasing sampling rates tend to generate more realistic land surface fluxes.The results from our study indicate that streamflow simulations from VIC model using precipitation forcing at 6-hourly integration outperforms the simulations as compared to 3-hourly and 12-hourly forcing integration times. This is exemplified by the statistical indices, with mean relative error of 0.17 for simulations with 3-hourly forcing, 0.12 for simulation with 6-hourly forcing, and 0.57 for 12-hourly forcing. Therelative Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE)for 3-hourly, 6-hourly, 12-hourly for 2015 are 0.31, 0.25, 1.43 and for 2016 are 0.25, 0.15, 1.06,respectively. It canbe noticedthat bothmean relative errorandrelative RMSEshowa similar pattern for bothyears. A generic framework is therefore proposed to study the manifestation of satellite constellation sampling uncertainty in hydrologic simulations, which are crucial for future missions such as the CubeSat-based Temporal Experiment for Storms and Tropical Systems, and the Time-Resolved Observations of precipitation structure and storm intensity with a constellation of smallsats.",

            "abstractNote": "The vegetation optical depth (VOD), a vegetation index retrieved from passive or active microwave remote sensing systems, is related to the intensity of microwave extinction effects within the vegetation canopy layer. This index is only marginally impacted by effects from atmosphere, clouds and sun illumination, and thus increasingly used for ecological applications at large scales. Newly released VOD products show different abilities in monitoring vegetation features, depending on the algorithm used and the satellite frequency. VOD is increasingly sensitive to the upper vegetation layer as the frequency increases (from L-, C- to X-band), offering different capacities to monitor seasonal changes of the leafy and/or woody vegetation components, vegetation water status and aboveground biomass. This study evaluated nine recently developed/reprocessed VOD products from the AMSR2, SMOS and SMAP space-borne instruments for monitoring structural vegetation features related to phenology, height and aboveground biomass. For monitoring the seasonality of green vegetation (herbaceous and woody foliage), we found that X-VOD products, particularly from the LPDR-retrieval algorithm, outperformed the other VOD products in regions that are not densely vegetated, where they showed higher temporal correlation values with optical vegetation indices (VIs). However, LPDR X-VOD time series failed to detect changes in VOD after rainfall events whereas most other VOD products could do so, and overall daily variations are less pronounced in LPDR X-VOD. Results show that the reprocessed VODCA C- and X-VOD have almost comparable performance and VODCA C-VOD correlates better with VIs than other C-VOD products. Low frequency L-VOD, particularly the new version (V2) of SMOS-IC, show a higher temporal correlation with VIs, similar to C-VOD, in medium-densely vegetated biomes such as savannas (R\u00a0~\u00a00.70) than for other short vegetation types. Because the L-VOD indices are more sensitive to the non-green vegetation components (trunks and branches) than higher frequency products, they are well-correlated with aboveground biomass: (R\u00a0~\u00a00.91) across space between predicted and observed values for both SMOS-IC V2 and SMAP MT-DCA. However, when compared with forest canopy height, results at L-band are not systematically better than C- and X-VOD products. This revealed specific VOD retrieval issues for some ecosystems, e.g., boreal regions. It is expected that these findings can contribute to algorithm refinements, product enhancements and further developing the use of VOD for monitoring above-ground vegetation biomass, vegetation dynamics and phenology.",

            "abstractNote": "Variations in autumn phenology (i.e., the end of growing season, EOS) in recent decades have been suggested to be the dynamic response of terrestrial ecosystems to global environmental change. However, predicting EOS change with climate variation is still challenging, given that there are several environmental factors that can affect EOS apart from warming. In this study, EOS over the Northern Hemisphere (>30\u00b0) was calculated by three different extracting methods using the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) records from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies third generation (GIMMS3g) during 1982 to 2015. We used partial correlation and partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analyses to investigate the EOS variations in response to five global environmental change factors, including temperature, precipitation, insolation, atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen (N) deposition. We found that about 58.5% (13.6% were significant) of the study area showed earlier EOS trends and 41.5% (10.3% were significant) with later EOS. Warming played a critical role in regulating EOS. The cumulative precipitation during the preseason had the greatest positive impact on EOS in arid/semiarid regions. Sufficient insolation could contribute to the delayed EOS over high latitudes. Compared with climatic factors, EOS also showed high sensitivity to changes in the atmospheric factors, and the dominant control of atmospheric CO2 and N deposition on EOS was found at 25\u201330% of the areas. Our results confirmed the dominant role of climatic factors in regulating EOS, but other global environmental cues, for instance, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition should also be included in the autumn phenological model to further understand the carbon and N cycles of terrestrial ecosystems with climate change.",

The western and northern boundaries (WB and NB) were revealed as the two aerosol importing gateways for ECC, with the annual mean cross-boundary efficiencies of 0.286\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.231 hr\u22121 for WB and 0.050\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.025 hr\u22121 for NB. The annual mean efficiency of the cross eastern boundary (EB) aerosol transport was \u22120.267\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.243 hr\u22121, indicating an overall aerosol exporting effect for ECC. More efficient cross southern boundary (SB) aerosol importing processes were found in July (0.049\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.071 hr\u22121) and August (0.043\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.058 hr\u22121), which favor the outbreak of Pacific Northwest wildfires. The aerosol emissions from Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR) in Alberta are unlikely to have significant impact on ECC via the cross-NB aerosol transport pathway. The annual mean aerosol extinction flow of 202\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02244\u00a0km2/h suggested the cross-boundary aerosol importing effect for ECC. The most significant aerosol importing effect for ECC was found in fall, indicated by seasonal mean aerosol extinction flow of 680\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01122\u00a0km2/h. The observed seasonal variation implied the noticeable influences of aerosol local emissions and cloud-aerosol interactions on ECC aerosol loadings in winter and summer. To obtain a complete picture of aerosol loading budget over ECC, further investigations on the dynamics of aerosol emissions and depositions happened in the ECC atmosphere remain.",

            "abstractNote": "An extensive analysis of radiative flux biases in the Climate Forecast System Model Version 2 (CFSv2) is done. Annual mean and seasonal variations of biases at the surface and top of the atmosphere (TOA) are reported in the global domain. Large regional biases in shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiation are observed over convectively active zones in the tropics. The relative contribution of various processes responsible for the reported biases is quantified. The poor simulation of clouds and inadequate representation of surface properties seem to be major contributors. Over certain regions, errors due to different processes add up, whereas, over other regions, errors tend to nullify each other. Surface and atmospheric variables taken as input parameters in the radiative transfer modules are compared with satellite-based observations. The maximum biases in SW and LW radiation are observed over the regions of persistent low clouds. The magnitude of the SW and LW biases at the TOA is in phase with the biases in cloud fraction by and large. However, the error in the radiative fluxes due to errors in surface radiative properties is of equal importance. The cold bias in near-surface air temperature reported in other studies may partly be attributed to an underestimation in the net SW radiation at the surface. In the present study, a plausible prescription is also provided to correct the source of the biases.",

            "abstractNote": "Atmospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) is a potential pollutant and very harmful to public health at higher doses. There are different sources for HCHO in the atmosphere, in which fuel combustion and biomass burning are predominant. The oxidation of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and methane are the chemical production pathways of HCHO in the troposphere. Here, we show a different source of HCHO emission to the atmosphere; the maritime shipping. The analyses using satellite measurements for the period 2005\u20132014 reveal large amounts of HCHO release along the ship routes in Indian Ocean, about 7\u20138 x1015 molec./cm2. This is nearly twice (150\u2013200%) the ambient or background HCHO levels (about 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015 molec./cm2), when there is no ship emissions in the north Indian Ocean. The trend in HCHO concentrations over the Indian Ocean sea routes is about 0.008\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015 molec./cm2/year. The amount and the increasing trends of HCHO over the maritime routes in the north Indian Ocean are also comparable to those of the busiest sea-lanes in the world Oceans, such as the Panama Canal, Mediterranean Sea and Strait of Malacca. Our analyses, henceforth, suggest use of a better fuel for shipping to reduce the maritime pollution, as the polluted air can often be transported to the coastal regions and islands, which is a concern for public health in those regions.",

While most climate models predict an intensified monsoon and increase in flood risk with warming, robust baseline estimates of natural climate variability in the basin are limited by the short observational record. Here we use a new seven-century (1309\u20132004 C.E) tree-ring reconstruction of monsoon season Brahmaputra discharge to demonstrate that the early instrumental period (1956\u20131986 C.E.) ranks amongst the driest of the past seven centuries (13th percentile). Further, flood hazard inferred from the recurrence frequency of high discharge years is severely underestimated by 24\u201338% in the instrumental record compared to previous centuries and climate model projections. A focus on only recent observations will therefore be insufficient to accurately characterise flood hazard risk in the region, both in the context of natural variability and climate change.",

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the Midwestern United States were estimated by the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), with and without assimilating OCO-2 retrievals by the extended-DART. To focus on evaluating the effect of the assimilation, the study period was deliberately set to January 2016, the coldest month in the dormant season, to minimize the influence of biogenic CO2 flux. Independent ground-based and flight observations, as well as the CarbonTracker 2017 products (CT2017), were used to evaluate the results of two distinct approaches. Comparing to the estimated CO2 concentration distribution without assimilating the OCO-2 retrievals, the overall root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) between the results with the assimilation and the observations were averagely reduced by 20.65% and 78.49%, the overall difference in the RMSE and MBE with respect to CT2017 were averagely reduced by 48.29% and 28.61%, respectively. Experiments showed that the assimilation of OCO-2 retrievals by the extended-DART could make the estimated CO2 concentration distribution significantly more consistent with the observations and the CarbonTracker products.",

In the Sahel, changes in surface temperature gradients and associated changes in wind shear have been found to be important for MCS intensification in recent decades. Here we extend that analysis to southern West Africa (SWA) by combining 34 years of cloud-top temperatures with rainfall and reanalysis data. We identify clear trends in intense MCSs since 1983 and their associated atmospheric drivers. We also find a marked annual cycle in the drivers, linked to changes in the convective regime during the progression of the West African monsoon. Before the peak of the first rainy season, we identify a shear regime where increased temperature gradients play a crucial role for MCS intensity trends. From June onward, SWA moves into a less unstable, moist regime during which MCS trends are mainly linked to frequency increase and may be more influenced by total column water vapor. However, during both seasons we find that MCSs with the most intense convection occur in an environment with stronger wind shear, increased low-level humidity, and drier midlevels. Comparing the sensitivity of MCS intensity and peak rainfall to low-level moisture and wind shear conditions preceding events, we find a dominant role for wind shear. We conclude that MCS trends are directly linked to a strengthening of two distinct convective regimes that cause the seasonal change of SWA MCS characteristics. However, the convective environment that ultimately produces the most intense MCSs remains the same.</p></section>",

            "abstractNote": "The Amazon Basin, a major driver of atmospheric CO2 fluxes, is composed of moist tropical forest (> 2000\u00a0mm mean annual precipitation), seasonally moist tropical forests (< 2000\u00a0mm mean annual precipitation), croplands, and pastures. It is debated whether there is a dry-season increase in photosynthesis for moist forest and a large reduction in photosynthesis of tropical South America was recently cited as a major driver of the historically high atmospheric CO2 growth rate during the 2015/2016 El Ni\u00f1o. To address this debate and to gain insight into changes in dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis during El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, here we investigate (1) dry-season changes in satellite-based greenness, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and photosynthesis during 2007\u20132017 and (2) anomalies of satellite-based dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis for two El Ni\u00f1o events (2009/2010 and 2015/2016) and two La Ni\u00f1a events (2007/2008 and 2010/2011). We hypothesize that satellite-based greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis of moist tropical forests should increase during the dry season, and find this to be the case using two MODIS BRDF-adjusted vegetation indices (EVI and NDVI), GOME-2 SIF data, and the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM). We also hypothesize that dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis should be anomalously high during the El Ni\u00f1os, due to anomalously high photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and a relatively normal preceding wet season, and anomalously low during the La Ni\u00f1as because these dry seasons were preceded by anomalously low amounts of wet-season precipitation. For this hypothesis, we present results for moist tropical forest and at the basin scale to determine if and by how much their anomalies differ. We find dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis of moist tropical forest and at the basin scale were statistically significantly lower than normal during the La Ni\u00f1as, significantly higher than normal during the 2009/2010 El Ni\u00f1o, and were mixed for the 2015/2016 El Ni\u00f1o. Although statistically significant, the magnitudes of the dry-season anomalies were not substantial. Our findings provide additional evidence that photosynthesis of moist tropical Amazon forest increases during the dry season and narrows the potential drivers of perturbations to the atmospheric CO2 growth rate during the last four ENSO events, as anomalies in dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis during these ENSO events were minute.",

To rapidly respond to this pandemic and offer data support for various communities (e.g., decision-makers in health departments and governments, researchers in academia, public citizens), the National Science Foundation (NSF) spatiotemporal innovation center constructed a spatiotemporal platform with various task forces including international researchers and implementation strategies. Compared to similar platforms that only offer viral and health data, this platform views virus-related environmental data collection (EDC) an important component for the geospatial analysis of the pandemic. The EDC contains environmental factors either proven or with potential to influence the spread of COVID-19 and virulence or influence the impact of the pandemic on human health (e.g., temperature, humidity, precipitation, air quality index and pollutants, nighttime light (NTL)). In this platform/framework, environmental data are processed and organized across multiple spatiotemporal scales for a variety of applications (e.g., global mapping of daily temperature, humidity, precipitation, correlation of the pandemic to the mean values of climate and weather factors by city). This paper introduces the raw input data, construction and metadata of reprocessed data, and data storage, as well as the sharing and quality control methodologies of the COVID-19 related environmental data collection.",

            "abstractNote": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only affected health and economics, but also its effect extended to include other aspects, such as the environment. Using Egypt as a case study, this paper presents the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution levels by studying nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter represented in absorbing aerosol index (AAI), carbon monoxide (CO), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper also highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on other environmental indicators including environmental noise, medical and municipal solid wastes. The paper presents the Egyptian COVID-19 story from its different angles including the development of confirmed COVID-19 cases, containment measures from the government, the impact on the country's economy and the national energy consumption so as to effectively evaluate the effect on both the air pollution levels and the other studied environmental indicators. For the other environmental indicators, a strong link was observed between COVID-19 lockdown and the reduction in environmental noise, beaches, surface and groundwater pollution. For environmental noise, this has been confirmed by officially governmental announcements which reported that the level of environmental noise in Egypt was reduced by about 75% during the lockdown period. On the other hand, there are some negative effects, including an increase in medical solid waste (from 70 to 300 ton/day), municipal solid waste, as well as a less efficient solid waste recycling process. For air pollution levels, the data were obtained from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency satellite data sets. The data for the lockdown period in 2020 have been extracted and compared to the corresponding months in the selected baseline period (2015\u20132019) to identify the effect that the lockdown period had on the air pollution levels in Egypt with focus on Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It was found that the AAI decreased by about 30%, the NO2 decreased by 15 and 33% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates, respectively, and that the CO decreased by about 5% over both governorates. In addition, the GHG emissions in Egypt were reduced by at least 4% during the pandemic. In contrast, ozone levels increased by about 2% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It can be concluded that the implemented containment measures during COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in both positive and negative environmental impacts. The positive environmental impacts are not sustainable and deterioration on them is expected to occur after the lockdown as it was before the pandemic. Therefore, stricter laws must be enacted to protect the environment in Egypt.",

            "abstractNote": "Changes in precipitation pattern have been associated with global warming and is of more importance particularly for monsoon dependent regions such as India, which receives maximum rainfall from south-west monsoon. Indian land mass is surrounded by ocean from three sides named Arabian Sea (AS), Bay of Bengal (BOB) and rest of the Indian Ocean (IO) which makes its climate more sensitive. To understand the effect of global warming, long term (1960\u20132017) annually averaged in-situ sea surface temperature (SST) is studied which shows an increasing trend (~\u20090.11\u00a0\u00b0C/decade; P\u2009<\u20090.05) with higher variations (r2AS\u2009=\u20090.46; r2BOB\u2009=\u20090.43) over AS and BOB whereas comparatively lower in magnitude (~\u20090.14\u00a0\u00b0C/decade; P\u2009<\u20090.05) with less variation (r2IO\u2009=\u20090.74) over IO. Rise in SST could vary evaporation rate, moisture content, cloud temperature and initial conditions required for cloud formation. To understand this heterogeneity in conjunction with seasonal variation, present study correlates cloud microphysical properties such as cloud effective radius (CER) with SST and aerosol optical depth (AOD) at high-resolution (1\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00b0) using linear interpolation method during 2001\u20132016. Features of north-east monsoon captures with high (~\u20090.006\u20130.012\u00a0kg/kg) specific humidity at 850\u00a0hPa, positive correlation (~\u20090.1\u20130.8) of SST-CER and negative correlation (~\u2009\u2212\u20090.1 to\u2009~\u2009\u2212\u20090.8) of AOD\u2013CER over BOB which may imply formation of bigger droplets due to presence of more moisture and less AOD. Though these patches show prominent results, it also shows scattered interpolation signifying role of other parameters on CER. Findings would be promising with more parameters, which can be used as an input data in climate models to understand regional climate variability.",

            "abstractNote": "Remote sensing is a useful tool for observing the water cycle. However, combining remote sensing products over any major river basin will result in a residual error in the overall water balance. Previous studies have either quantified this error without correcting it, or have merged observations together with land surface models (LSMs) to produce a single \u201cbest\u201d estimate of the water balance. Here, we present a new approach in which combinations of remote sensing and in situ observations are constrained to enforce water balance closure. Rather than a single estimate, this produces an ensemble of unique water balance estimates intended to characterize uncertainty and to avoid biases implicit in LSMs. We evaluate three techniques of varying complexity to enforce water balance closure for individual ensemble members over 24 global basins from Oct. 2002 - Dec. 2014, resulting in as many as 60 realizations of the monthly water budget, contingent upon data availability. Compared with a published climate data record, the ensemble shows strong agreement for precipitation, evapotranspiration and changes in storage (R2: 0.91\u20130.95), with less agreement for streamflow (R2: 0.42\u20130.47), which may be indicative of LSM biases in the climate data record. Water balance residual errors resulting from combinations of raw products vary significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) with latitude, with a tendency for positive biases for low- and mid-latitude basins, and negative biases elsewhere. Overall, residual errors are equivalent to 15% of total precipitation when averaged across all data products and basins. This study shows that closure constraints provide additional value outside of closing the water budget, including reduction of uncertainty and transfer of closure constraints in time to provide skillful estimates of mean annual basin discharge. We also showed that a simpler closure technique, proportional redistribution, performed better than more complex ones in decreasing uncertainty and for transfer through time to estimate basin discharge when a rigorous analysis of errors for each data product is not accounted for. This observation-based dataset is distinct from modeled estimates and therefore has the potential to preserve important information of anthropogenic effects on the water balance.",

            "abstractNote": "Morphological changes, caused by the erosion and deposition processes due to water discharge and sediment flux occur, in the banks along the river channels and in the estuaries. Flow rate is one of the most important factors that can change river morphology. The geometric shapes of the meanders and the river flow parameters are crucial components in the areas where erosion or deposition occurs in the meandering rivers. Extreme precipitation triggers erosion on the slopes, which causes significant morphological changes in large areas during and after the event. The flow and sediment amount observed in a river basin with extreme precipitation increases and exceeds the long-term average value. Hereby, erosion severity can be determined by performing spatial analyses on remotely sensed imagery acquired before and after an extreme precipitation event. Changes of erosion and deposition along the river channels and overspill channels can be examined by comparing multi-temporal Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based Digital Surface Model (DSM) data. In this study, morphological changes in the B\u00fcy\u00fck Menderes River located in the western Turkey, were monitored with pre-flood (June 2018), during flood (January 2019), and post-flood (September 2019) UAV surveys, and the spatial and volumetric changes of eroded/deposited sediment were quantified. For this purpose, the DSAS (Digital Shoreline Analysis System) method and the DEM of Difference (DoD) method were used to determine the changes on the riverbank and to compare the periodic volumetric morphological changes. Hereby, Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry technique was exploited to a low-cost UAV derived imagery to achieve riverbank, areal and volumetric changes following the extreme rainfall events extracted from the time series of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data. The change analyses were performed to figure out the periodic morphodynamic variations and the impact of the flood on the selected meandering structures. In conclusion, although the river water level increased by 0.4\u20135.9 meters with the flood occurred in January 2019, the sediment deposition areas reformed after the flood event, as the water level decreased. Two-year monitoring revealed that the sinuosity index (SI) values changed during the flood approached the pre-flood values over time. Moreover, it was observed that the amount of the deposited sediments in September 2019 approached that of June 2018.",

In this paper, changes in the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for the interval from 1971 to the end of May 2020 are examined. The values of SPEI (based on 12, 24 and 30 month windows, i.e., SPEI 12, SPEI 24 and SPEI 30) were calculated with the help of the Penman&ndash;Monteith equation. Changes in soil moisture contents were also examined from January 2000 to May 2020, based on data from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center, presenting increasing water shortages in a central belt of Poland. The study showed that the 2020 spring drought was among the most severe events in the analyzed period and presented decreasing trends of SPEI at most stations located in central Poland. This study also determined changes in soil moisture contents from January 2000 to May 2020 that indicate a decreasing tendency. Cumulative water shortages from year to year led to the development of severe drought in the spring of 2020, as reflected in very low SPEI values and low soil moisture.",

The radiative impact of mineral dust is one of the major contributors to inaccuracies in the satellite-retrieved sea surface skin temperature (SSTskin). Different aerosol dust vertical distributions have varying effects on the satellite-derived SSTskin. To further investigate the physical mechanisms of aerosol effects on Terra MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) derived SSTskin, the aerosol radiative effects were studied with a field-data match-up analysis and radiative transfer simulations. The field data are measurements of the SSTskin derived from highly accurate ship-based infrared spectrometers vertical atmospheric temperature and water vapor radiosonde profiles. The aerosol dust concentrations in three-dimensions from the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 have been used as input to radiative transfer simulations. Based on the analysis of field data and simulations, we have empirically determined that the sensitivity of the Terra MODIS retrieved SSTskin accuracies is related to 1) dust concentration in the atmosphere, 2) the dust layer altitude, and 3) the dust layer temperature. As the aerosol altitude increases, the effect on the SSTskin retrievals becomes more negative in proportion to the temperature contrast with the sea surface. SSTskin differences, satellite-derived - surface measurements, for a given aerosol layer optical depth vary between \u22123\u00a0K and 1\u00a0K according to our match-up comparisons and radiative transfer simulations.",

            "abstractNote": "Limiting the rise in global mean temperatures relies on reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and on the removal of CO2 by land carbon sinks. China is currently the single largest emitter of CO2, responsible for approximately 27 per cent (2.67\u00a0petagrams of carbon per year) of global fossil fuel emissions in 20171. Understanding of Chinese land biosphere fluxes has been hampered by sparse data coverage2\u20134, which has resulted in a wide range of a posteriori estimates of flux. Here we present recently available data on the atmospheric mole fraction of CO2, measured from six sites across China during 2009 to 2016. Using these data, we estimate a mean Chinese land biosphere sink of \u22121.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38\u00a0petagrams of carbon per year during 2010 to 2016, equivalent to about 45 per cent of our estimate of annual Chinese anthropogenic emissions over that period. Our estimate reflects a previously underestimated land carbon sink over southwest China (Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces) throughout the year, and over northeast China (especially Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces) during summer months. These provinces have established a pattern of rapid afforestation of progressively larger regions5,6, with provincial forest areas increasing by between 0.04 million and 0.44 million hectares per year over the past 10 to 15\u00a0years. These large-scale changes reflect the expansion of fast-growing plantation forests that contribute to timber exports and the domestic production of paper7. Space-borne observations of vegetation greenness show a large increase with time over this study period, supporting the timing and increase in the land carbon sink over these afforestation regions.",

In this research, bias adjustment of Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) (IMERG) snowfall estimates with 0.1\u00b0 spatial resolution and half-hour temporal resolution was performed over a basin located in the Western United States based on Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) ground station snow accumulation (SA) observations using the Gridded based Bias Adjustment using Copula (GBAC) approach. After dividing the study area into several boxes, usual and unusual pairs of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) were separated in station pixels. Then, simulated biases were obtained using multivariate copula functions in station boxes. Next, based on the T copula function, bias adjustment bands were generated during the calibration period in station pixels. This step was followed by the validation stage. Also, bias adjustment bands were generated in pixels with no station. Based on calibration results, in boxes located west of 120\u00b0 W, the range between the lower bound and the 10th percentile of the band had the most impact on satellite SA adjustment. Conversely, in boxes located east of 120\u00b0 W, the middle range of the band (between 10th and 90th percentiles) was more effective. Thus, longitude was an effective factor in satellite SA bias adjustment. The validation results showed that in station boxes with a longitude over 120\u00b0 west, the adjustment band was narrower. This is while in station boxes with longitude less than 120\u00b0 west, the bias adjustment band better encompassed the ground SA data.",

Here, we assess future (2040\u20132049) climate risk for the entire contiguous US at the county level with a novel climate risk index integrating multiple hazards, exposures and vulnerabilities. Future, weather and climate hazards are characterized as frequency of heat wave, cold spells, dryer, and heavy precipitation events along with anomalies of temperature and precipitation using high resolution (4\u00a0km) downscaled climate projections. Exposure is characterized by projections of population, infrastructure, and built surfaces prone to multiple hazards including sea level rise and storm surges. Vulnerability is characterized by projections of demographic groups most sensitive to climate hazards. We found Florida, California, the central Gulf Coast, and North Atlantic at high climate risk in the future. However, the contributions to this risk vary regionally. Florida is projected to be equally hard hit by the three components of climate risk. The coastal counties in the Gulf states of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama are at high climate risk due to high exposure and hazard. High exposure and vulnerability drive high climate risk in California counties. This approach can guide planners in targeting counties at most risk and where adaptation strategies to reduce exposure or protect vulnerable populations might be best applied.",

The distribution of W derived from approximately 100 Landsat-8 scenes was compared with quasi-synchronous scatterometer measurements of wind speed (u10), which allowed us to obtain the W(u10) relation for large whitecaps from high-resolution satellite optical measurements. Further, we demonstrate the impact of various phenomena, including- internal waves, river plumes, bottom topography, atmospheric stability, ocean fronts, and mesoscale currents on whitecap coverage and its spatial variation in different areas of the ocean. These data are analysed using theoretical models, suggesting that whitecap coverage is a proxy of wave energy dissipation and reflects disturbances in the wind-wave energy balance caused by wave-current interactions and variable wind forcing due to changes in atmospheric stratification over ocean temperature fronts and the movement of wind-waves by surface currents relative to the atmospheric boundary layer.",

TC intensity had a positive correlation with warm-core strength (correlation coefficient of 0.8556). The warm-core strength increased gradually from 1 K for tropical depression (TD) to &gt;15 K for super typhoon (Super TY). The vertical areas affected by the warm core expanded as TC intensity increased. The positive correlation between TC intensity and warm-core height was slightly weaker. The warm-core heights for TD, tropical storm (TS), and severe tropical storm (STS) were concentrated between 300 and 500 hPa, while those for typhoon (TY), severe typhoon (STY), and Super TY varied from 200 to 350 hPa. Analyses of the cloud macro-/micro-physical properties showed that the top of TC cloud systems mainly consisted of ice clouds. For TCs of all intensities, areas near the TC center showed lower cloud-top pressures and lower cloud-top temperatures, more cloud fractions, and larger ice-cloud effective diameters. With the increase in TC intensity, the levels of ice clouds around the TC center became higher and the spiral cloud-rain bands became larger. When a TC developed into a TY, STY, or Super TY, the convection in the clouds was stronger, releasing more heat, thus forming a much warmer warm core.",

            "abstractNote": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) play an important role in the precipitation of tropical oceans and islands. The temporal and spatial characteristics of precipitation have become more complex in recent years with climate change. Global warming tips the original water and energy balance in oceans and atmosphere, giving rise to extreme precipitation events. In this study, the monthly precipitation ratio method, spatial analysis, and correlation analysis were employed to detect variations in precipitation in the South China Sea (SCS). The results showed that the contribution of TCs was 5.9% to 10.1% in the rainy season and 7.9% to 16.8% in the dry season. The seven islands have the same annual variations in the precipitation contributed by TCs. An 800 km radius of interest was better for representing the contribution of TC-derived precipitation than a 500 km conventional radius around reclaimed islands in the SCS. Four track patterns of TCs were defined. The order according to the primary pattern of contribution was I (26&ndash;85.3%) &gt; IV (12.8&ndash;29.8%) &gt; III (4.3&ndash;29%) &gt; II (11.5&ndash;24%). The average distance between islands and TCs was 1163 and 712 km in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. The average contribution was larger in La Ni&ntilde;a than in El Ni&ntilde;o periods. These results could be beneficial for managing rainwater resources, especially the TC-induced precipitation in the reclaimed islands.",

            "abstractNote": "Snow albedo is an important variable in the coupled atmosphere-earth system at the global level. Moreover, studying its behavior allows us to know the state of the cryosphere. The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM) is a glacier area and the northernmost tropical (10.82&deg; N, 73.75&deg; W) region in South America. It has a height of up to 5775 m.a.sl., which is the second highest mountain in the world near the marine coast. We analyzed variations in snow albedo related to snow cover, snowfall, temperature, light-absorbing impurities such as blank carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC) and dust, and El Ni&ntilde;o&mdash;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon through 20 years (2000&ndash;2020). We mainly use daily data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua NASA satellites. Results showed through correlations that snow albedo has decreased due to Land Surface Temperature (55%, p &lt; 0.001), a positive phase of ENSO (42%, p &lt; 0.001) and dust (37%, p &lt; 0.01) in the SNSM. Additionally, a dust negative effect was more evident on the southern side (up to 49%, p &lt; 0.001) of the SNSM. Backward trajectories by the NOAA HYSPLIT model suggest that dust sources would be soil erosion in the surrounding region. Results can help recognize the influence of ENSO and dust in the glacier decrease of the SNSM.",

            "abstractNote": "For this study particle flux material collected over 13\u00a0years period starting in February 2002 until summer 2015 with the long-term mooring Kiel 276 (33\u00b0N, 22\u00b0W) in the subtropical Northeast Atlantic was analyzed. Our focus was set on the elemental composition and trace element fluxes which we analyzed with the help of ICP-OES and ICP-MS. The particle flux has a mean of 60\u00a0mg\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121 (range: 1\u2013365\u00a0mg\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121) with peak fluxes during February and April shortly after the winter bloom. Especially in 2004 high fluxes occurred through the year when the Azores Front was located south of the mooring. In this year enhanced nutrient supply and high dust concentration in the atmosphere were measured. The analyzed trace elements of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, V, Zn, Zr, and Mn have mean fluxes of 43.4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Cd\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121, 205.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Co\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121, 1.4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Cr\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121, 3.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Cu\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121, 1.6\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Ni\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121, 1.0\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0V\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121, 5.1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Zn\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121, 1.3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Zr\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121, and 7.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Mn\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121. Biogenic trace elements (Cd, Zn, Ni) show maximum fluxes in winter and spring while no seasonality was present for refractory (Zr) and redox-sensitive elements (V, Mn, Co). Fe, Ti, Co, Mn, V, Mn, and Zr are only little enriched towards the upper continental crust (EF\u00a0<\u00a02) as these elements originate from a lithogenic source and are little prone to dissolution or scavenging while Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Zn are more enriched with EF of 3.0, 9.6, 2.4, 6.2, and 5.0, respectively.",

The performance of NWP models become more sensitive to their grid resolutions, when they are used for simulation of severe weather events, such as a cyclonic storm. In this paper, we present a detailed assessment of an intense convective episode with heavy precipitation associated with the passage of a very severe cyclonic storm \u201cOCKHI\u201d using the Consortium for Small-scale Modelling (COSMO). A set of distinct numerical simulations are carried out using COSMO to address the impact of grid resolution and the treatment of explicit and implicit convection. Results obtained from the present investigation indicate that explicit treatment of convection in the COSMO model led to improved prediction of the cyclonic event in terms of sea level pressure, maximum sustained surface wind speeds and the accumulated rainfall, but reduction of the spatial grid resolution from 7 to 3 km did not show appreciable differences in the forecast fields. Conclusively, the current study recommends switching off the convection parameterization scheme at a grid resolution of 7 km for improved predictability of tropical cyclones.",

            "abstractNote": "Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is a key variable in global and regional hydrological cycles. In this study, the TWS changes in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) were derived using the Lagrange multiplier method (LMM) from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data. To assess TWS changes from LMM, different GRACE solutions, different hydrological models, and in situ data were used for validation. Results show that TWS changes from LMM in YRB has the best performance with the correlation coefficients of 0.80 and root mean square error of 1.48 cm in comparison with in situ data. The trend of TWS changes over the YRB increased by 10.39 \u00b1 1.27 Gt yr-1 during the 2003\u22122015 period. Moreover, TWS change is disintegrated into the individual contributions of hydrological components (i.e., glaciers, surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater) from satellite data, hydrologic models, and in situ data. The estimated changes in individual TWS components in the YRB show that (1) the contribution of glaciers, surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater to total TWS changes is 15%, 12%, 25% and 48%, respectively; (2) Geladandong glacier melt from CryoSat-2/ICESat data has a critical effect on TWS changes with a correlation coefficients of \u22120.51; (3) the Three Gorges Reservoir Impoundment has a minimal effect on surface water changes (mainly lake water storage), but it has a substantial effect on groundwater storage (GWS), (4) the Poyang and Doting Lake water storage changes are mainly caused by climate change, (5) soil moisture storage change is mainly influenced by surface water, (6) human-induced GWS changes accounted for approximately half of the total GWS. The results of this study can provide valuable information for decision-making in water resources management.",

The research reveals seasonal, temporal as well as spatial dependence of rain height over the regions. The average annual Zero Degree Isotherm Heights (ZDIH) and rain height in the Sub-Sahelian regions are 4.796\u00a0km and 5.11\u00a0km respectively while the corresponding values in the Coastal regions are 4.845\u00a0km and 4.91\u00a0km. The results show that the values recommended by the International Telecommunication Union Radio section (ITU-R) underestimate both ZDIH and rain height. Atmospheric parameters at rain height levels were also compared with rain height. Among all the atmospheric parameters considered, the result shows that variation of rain height in both regions depends strongly on temperature with a determination coefficient (r2) of 0.73 and 0.85 in the Sub-Sahelian and Coastal regions respectively. The recommended rain heights will aid better prediction and mitigation of rain-induced attenuation to optimize the performance of earth-space satellite links in Nigeria.",

            "abstractNote": "In this paper, we provide a holistic view of the hydro-sedimentological regimes of the Chao Phraya River (CPR) Basin, the fifth largest basin in Southeast Asia. Our analysis of daily discharge and sediment data from 42 major gauge stations showed high seasonal variation in the suspended sediment discharge (Qs), with the maximum discharge occurring in October on an inter-annual average. At Nakhon Sawan, the river discharges 304x104 tons of sediment every year, 60% of which is transported in the peak flooding months (September to November). The peak sediment discharge in October is dramatically attenuated at a station 150 km downstream from Nakhon Sawan, mainly due to discharge diversion to irrigation canals, distributaries, and branches, as well as seasonal flooding over the Central Plain. Sediment yield (SY) calculated at major stations showed spatial variability across the basin, generally decreasing in a downstream direction (i.e. as drainage area increases) (R2=0.55). Some stations in the upper basin\u2019s watersheds showed SY as high as >700 tons/km2/yr, which is comparable to upstream catchments of other large rivers with high sediment production. Two significant sediment sinks were identified in this study: the Bhumibol and Sirikit dams (each on Ping and Nan Rivers) - which trap \u223c236x104 tons of sediment each year (\u223c90% trapping rate) - as well as the floodplain of the CPR which stores 176 x104 tons annually along the 150 km downstream reach from Nakhon Sawan (\u223c60% of Qs at Nakhon Sawan). By extrapolating the floodplain sediment budget, we estimate that around 300x104 tons/yr of suspended sediment can be stored downstream of Nakhon Sawan (to the Gulf); comparable to the total annual storage of the two mega dams upstream. Although these dams have been previously reported to cause substantial sediment starvation in the CPR Delta, this study is the first to recognize the important role of lowland storage on the CPR\u2019s basin\u2019s sediment discharge to the Gulf of Thailand, and how it contributes a similar degree of threat to the shrinking delta.",

Measurement and interpretation of the snow PSDs is a topic of active research. This study investigates snow PSDs during 3 year of observations from Parsivel2 disdrometers and precipitation imaging packages (PIP) at five different sites in the PyeongChang region of South Korea. Variabilities in the values of the density of snow (&rho;), snowfall rate (S), and ice water content (IWC) are studied. To further understand the characteristics of snow PSD at different density and snowfall rate, the snow particle size distribution measurements are divided into six classes based on the density values of snowfall and five classes based on snowfall rates. The mean shape factors (Dm, log10Nw, and &mu;) of normalized gamma distribution are also derived based on different density and snowfall rate classes. The Dm decreases and log10Nw and &mu; increase as the density increases. The Dm and log10Nw increase and &mu; decreases with the increase of snowfall rate. The power-law relationship between &rho; and Dm is obtained and the relationship between S and IWC is also derived.",

            "abstractNote": "Terrestrial Essential Climate Variables, known as terrestrial ECVs, are key sources of information for both application- and scientific- oriented research. A large number of global terrestrial ECV products have been derived from satellite observations, and more are forthcoming. To unlock the full potential of these products, end-users need to know their uncertainties and error magnitudes. Due to the lack of conformity among validation strategies, a wide range of validation approaches have been employed to assess the quality of these products, and have resulted in reduced comparability even for the same terrestrial ECV. Addressing this challenge in validation practices requires the use of unified, standard, publicly available, traceable and objective validation procedures that are operational for all products of a specific terrestrial ECV, and preferably also applicable for all ECVs at the global scale. This can allow end-users to perform comparative assessments. To this end, the current study aims to investigate the readiness status of a selected group of seven global long-term satellite-based terrestrial ECVs for operational validation. Selected variables are Leaf Area Index (LAI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Evapotranspiration (ET), Soil Moisture (SM), Albedo, the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR), and Land Cover (LC). For each of these terrestrial ECVs, we reviewed key prerequisites and primary tools [notably, long term global product availability, globally distributed in situ measurement availability, a validation good practice protocol, and an online validation platform] required for developing an operational validation system. With respect to the \u201creadiness level\u201d, the investigation results demonstrate that LAI, SM, and LC are at the highest level of readiness for moving toward a full operational validation at the global scale. However, ET is at the lowest level of readiness, mainly due to the lack of standard validation good practice protocol and lack of a pilot online validation platform. The remainder of the selected terrestrial ECVs are identified to be at mid-level readiness, mainly because either a validation platform (i.e., LST and albedo) or good practice protocol (i.e., fAPAR) still needs to be developed. This review can pave the way for open-access, traceable, transparent, and operational validation procedures of satellite-based global terrestrial ECVs.",

High-resolution multiplatform measurements from radiosonde coupled with ozonesonde, Very High-Frequency (VHF) radar and Micro-Limb Sounder (MLS) and Indian National Satellite System (INSAT-3D) satellite measurements are used for the present study. The most significant observation is that there is an increase of ozone by 30\u00a0ppbv in the upper troposphere and decrease by 100\u2013110\u00a0ppbv in the lower stratosphere and this condition persisted for three successive days. The wind shows the presence of jet-stream in the vicinity of tropopause, enhancing the turbulence due to wind shear during the event of stratospheric intrusion. Further, the vertical velocity shows the presence of strong updrafts and downdrafts in the vicinity of tropopause which manifests the tropopause oscillation. Global analysis of satellite and reanalysis data also indicates the horizontal intrusion of stratospheric air from the mid-latitude to upper troposphere over the Bharati station. These observations constitute the first multi-instrumented, experimental evidence of stratospheric intrusions over the coastal Antarctica. These results are presented and discussed in the light of present understanding of turbulence and tropopause oscillation.",

            "abstractNote": "There are several different types of sources responsible for the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and aerosols in Africa. These emissions make the African continent vulnerable to the impacts on climate change, human health and the environment. It has been shown that the southern African emissions are dominant in the winter season (JJA). However, few studies have been done to study the winter and spring season in unison to understand these emissions. Therefore, in this study, both satellite data, such as Sentinel-5P and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), and reanalysis data from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), were used to study emissions in the 2019 JJASO period. Furthermore, the sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) test was used to study the trends of SO2, CO, Angstrom exponent and UV aerosol index data during the 2019 JJASO period. The results from sentinel-5P showed the dominance of CO and NO2 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and dominance of SO2 and NO2 in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). These emissions were largely from wildfires and coal-fired power stations, respectively. However, an SO2 hot spot was also observed over the DRC region which was found to be from an active volcano. CALIPSO data agreed with these observations and further showed the maximum vertical distribution of these aerosols and gases to be at ~\u20092\u00a0km. The SQMK test of Angstrom exponent and UV aerosol index showed that aerosol dominance from emissions change during the JJASO period. Therefore, studying the JJASO period does give a better understanding of emissions in southern Africa.",

It is unclear how the quality of the latest IMERG data products compares to that of the delisted TMPA series data sets. This study evaluated the accuracy of TRMM 3B42 version 7 and IMERG final version 6 products at 677 stations in the 7 subregions of China over 2000\u20132019 at the daily, monthly and annual timescales based on gauge-observed precipitation data. The performance of TMPA and IMERG precipitation products was assessed by six statistical indices. The product with the best performance was corrected based on the linear relationship of monthly precipitation between remote sensing products and ground-observed precipitation. The correction was then used for the predicting and mapping of precipitation in July 2019. The results showed that (1) IMERG outperformed TMPA at all three timescales, and the accuracy increased with the expanding timescale. (2) IMERG exhibited better performance in all subregions than TMPA and performed best in the mid-temperate semihumid zone and worst in the mid-temperature arid zone. (3) IMERG showed higher accuracy than TMPA in all months for most subregions and mainland China but performed worst in dry (December, January and February) and wet (July, August and September) months. (4) The linear relationship between remote sensing products and ground-observed precipitation could be used to correct and predict satellite precipitation data without up-to-date gauge observations, the predicted map indicated the good spatial variation in precipitation and better accuracy than the original IMERG data. In conclusion, the IMERG dataset was more accurate and could be used for precipitation investigations at large scales in China.",

During the snow accumulation season, EALs transport substantial amounts of dust to the snow-covered slopes of high-mountain Asia (HMA). Here we use multiple satellite-based estimates to demonstrate a robust physical association between the EALs and dust-induced snow darkening over HMA. Results from a fully coupled atmosphere\u2013chemistry\u2013snow model support these observations, revealing across HMA a signature of increasing dust-induced snow darkening with surface elevation that peaks near 4,500\u2009m. Moreover, the influence of dust on snow darkening is greater than that of black carbon above 4,000\u2009m. Our findings suggest a discernible role of dust in the observed spatial heterogeneity of snowmelt and snowline trends over HMA and highlight an increasing contribution of dust to snowmelt as the snowline rises with warming.",

            "abstractNote": "Owing to its large population, unique topography, and rapid industrialization and urbanization, the Sichuan Basin (SCB) is one of the most polluted regions in China, as reflected by the large aerosol optical depth (AOD). In this study, the credibility of two long-term atmospheric composition reanalysis datasets\u2014the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA)\u2014are evaluated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products over the SCB during 2003\u20132018. The time series of the three datasets at seasonal, monthly and annual scales exhibit some interesting similarities and differences, but with all of them demonstrating a prominent slowing down of the severe air pollution status over the SCB since 2012 (\u22120.25/7yrs for MODIS and CAMSRA and \u22120.12/7yrs for MERRA-2). CAMSRA shows good consistency with MODIS at all time scales (correlation coefficients varying from 0.89 to 0.97\u00a0at four seasons) despite its systematic overestimation (\uff5e0.2) throughout the 16-year study period. MERRA-2 has a negative deviation during 2003\u20132006 and then maintains an increasing positive deviation in the following years (0.05\u20130.2). This positive bias increases as MODIS AOD declines prominently from 2014. The good temporal consistency of CAMSRA is partly attributable to the bias correction of the assimilated remotely sensed AOD from MODIS and AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer). The differences between the reanalysis and MODIS are obvious during October\u2013December, which may be related to the cloud contamination effects as well as the uncertainties of emissions in each model system. The uniform decreasing trend of the three datasets since 2012 supports the effects of the tough emissions reduction policy, which is also evident in AOD changes of anthropogenic species. It is concluded that atmospheric composition reanalysis data with good spatial and temporal coverage can be considered in future air quality analyses over the SCB. However, the bias and regional dependence should be handled carefully.",

            "abstractNote": "Highest geomorphic activity in the central Nepal Himalayas is mainly driven by monsoonal precipitation. In contrast, the northern flanks of the Nepal Himalaya lay in the relative dry rain shadow of the mountain range. During the monsoon 2018, major floods and geomorphic events occurred in the Kali Gandaki (KG) valley impacting both the monsoon-affected and the dry parts of the catchments. We analyze the events and its triggers based on field observations, multiple satellite image interpretation, climatological analysis using Global Precipitation Measurement and MODIS snow cover data, hydrological analysis and media analysis. The hydro-meteorological triggers are complex. Exceptional precipitation in April and May 2018 occurred in the entire study area, followed by a rather dry period. Precipitation in August was exceptional in the northern part whereas below average in the South. We argue that dynamics of snow accumulation and delayed melting contributed significantly to flooding and increased geomorphic activity in the southern part in August whereas flooding in the northern part was mainly triggered by rainfalls. We thus define 2018 as an abnormal (pre-)monsoon year with less rainfall than average but being more catastrophic. Sediment dynamics in the study area are still controlled by the Dhampu rock avalanche dam and the braided river floodplain north of this knickpoint, where sediment pulses delivered from tributaries are rarely connected from the main river. During the monsoon floods 2018 sediment connectivity was given for most tributaries due to the steepness of the catchments. The study area is subject to major human impact. Mostly in the south, numerous hillslopes have been undercut by road construction, leading to higher geomorphic sensitivity. Severe landslides might thus be triggered in future even by less intense rainfall events. Magnitude and frequency of such abnormal (pre-)monsoon precipitation are highly relevant for sediment flux and natural hazards studies.",

As the study area, the Nanliujiang River Basin (NRB) located in the coastal tropics of southern China has a hill-karst combined landform. Based on the Ground Observations (GO) from 14 gauges of NRB, the SE of three IMERG products with the highest resolution of 0.5\u202fh are evaluated under 12\u202fdays. Then, by selecting daily SE, IMERG V06 is compared with its previous version (i.e., V05) from December 2016 to November 2017 while monthly SE of IMERG V06 are compared with that of TMPA 3B43 from 2008 to 2014. Besides the ordinary evaluation of the detection capability, correlation and error, a metric called Comprehensive Performance Index (CPI) is introduced to show the overall performance of the products. The main results of the comprehensive validation are that (1) IMERG keeps higher detection capability under low precipitation thresholds at the basin- or grid-scale. The diurnal variation of three 0.5\u202fh products' rainfall detection becomes obvious with threshold increasing. The advantage of IMERG V06 products over V05 in rainfall detection is small. (2) IMERG Final Run (IMERG-F) half-hourly product of V06 shows a high correlation with GO than the two near-real-time products at the partial gauges and dates. IMERG V06 outperforms than V05 or TMPA 3B43 on correlation at the basin-scale and partial gauges. (3) Main form of the biases presented in the validation of three IMERG products at 0.5\u202fh resolution and the comparison of IMERG V06 to other daily or monthly satellite products are reflected as rainfall overestimation and underestimation, respectively. Compared with V05 and 3B43, biases in the relatively cold and dry season are significantly improved by V06. (4) IMERG cannot reflect the spatial distribution of average precipitation with high values. The performance of SE changing between different gauges, which is shown as the spatial variability. (5) The number of gauges where IMERG-F of V06 has higher (or the highest) CPI values is the largest among each product combination of validation.",

Satellite products are among the effective methods of estimating ET and LAI at local, regional, and global scales. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate three global remote sensing products of ET and two products of LAI and investigate their simultaneous changes in Iran over the 2000 to 2015 period. Selected ET products include Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS2.0), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ET (MODIS ET) products. LAI products include MODIS LAI and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI products. Validation using the 23 selected evaporation stations showed that among the three ET products MODIS has the best performance. Three ET products consistently show an increasing trend in annual ET over a large part of Iran. The mean annual trend values obtained from GLEAM3.0a, GLDAS, and MODIS ET products are 2.022, 1.359, and 0.429 mm/year, respectively. Among LAI products, GLASS had the highest correlation with the selected ET product (0.78). On average, the trend of intra-annual changes of LAI across Iran did not show a significant increasing or decreasing trend. Moreover, in areas where no significant change was observed in LAI, ET changes were unpredictable and depended on other factors. Overall, the results showed a relatively strong correlation between the selected ET and vegetation satellite products in the study area.",

            "abstractNote": "Recent developments in terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) exposure dating and the reinterpretation of TCN boulder ages from moraines have improved our understanding of the glacial chronology in the Central Andes. According to these records, glacial advances throughout the region correlate with insolation-driven changes in the intensity of the South American Summer Monsoon and millennial-scale climate events such as Heinrich Stadials and the Younger Dryas. Quantifying the temperature and precipitation shifts during these events helps to constrain past moisture pathways and associated changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. Yet, particularly in the southern Central Andes, where a wealth of glacigenic landforms attests to formerly cooler and/or wetter conditions, the magnitudes of past temperature and precipitation changes are only loosely constrained at a few sites. Here, we present results from TCN-dated moraines combined with the reconstruction of former glaciers and paleolakes within the eastern sector of the southern Central Andes (24\u00b0\u201327\u00b0S) for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), and the Younger Dryas (YD). We performed Monte-Carlo simulations with 2-dimensional models of ice flow and lake hydrology that are forced by a spatially-distributed surface energy balance model. Our results indicate that temperatures were 3.0\u20134.2\u00a0\u00b0C, 2.0\u20133.3\u00a0\u00b0C and 1.3\u20132.5\u00a0\u00b0C cooler during the LGM, HS1 and YD, respectively, in agreement with previous estimates elsewhere in the Central Andes. We find that temperature changes during the late glacial are compatible with sea-surface temperature anomalies derived from the tropical Atlantic. Precipitation was only 5\u201327% greater than today, which contrasts with larger anomalies reconstructed for the Bolivian part of the Andean Plateau (Altiplano). We attribute this discrepancy to the southerly position of our study region with respect to the Bolivian High, supporting the hypothesis that this atmospheric pressure system played a prominent role for South American Summer Monsoon dynamics during glacial episodes.",

However, its impacts on terrestrial carbon cycle remain elusive. Here we investigated the vegetation responses to the heatwave and drought during 2018 based on satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and near-infrared reflectance (NIRv) data, which were used to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP). Results showed that there were no significant (p=\u00a00.60) reductions in GPP across most of Europe during April\u2013August of 2018. The higher temperatures in spring enhanced vegetation GPP, largely alleviated the negative impacts of heatwave and drought on vegetation photosynthesis during the subsequent summer, which resulted in evident compensation effects. Concurrently, warmer spring also had lagged effects by diminishing soil moisture, accompanied by scarce precipitation, leading to water stress on plant growth during summer. This observation-based study highlights the need for more considerations of seasonal compensation and lagged effects on the interactions between climate extreme events and biosphere.",

Based on the correlation with SM of SMAP, reanalyses, and GLDAS, it is found that the variations of SM observed by Liuhe and Chunan stations can generally represent the SM variations over eastern China. The correlation coefficients between the SMAP and station SM are around 0.7. The SMAP product can well capture the time variation of SM over eastern China. The spectral analysis suggests that periodic variations of SM are mainly and significantly over the 10\u201330-day period over eastern China in all the data. The significant spectra over the 10\u201330-day period basically occur during the rainy season over eastern China. For the spatial aspect of SSV-SM, precipitation is the main factor causing the spatial distribution of SSV-SM over eastern China. However, the spectra of the station precipitation are not consistent with those of the station SM, and there is less coherence between the precipitation and SM over the periods during which SM has significant spectra. This indicates that SSV-SM is also affected by other factors.",

            "abstractNote": "Groundwater is an essential component of the terrestrial water cycle and a key resource for supplying water to billions of people and for sustaining domestic and economic (agricultural and industrial) activities, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. The goal of this study is to analyze the recent groundwater changes which occurred in the major North African transboundary aquifers in the beginning of the 21st century. Groundwater storage anomalies were obtained by removing soil moisture in the root zone (and surface water in the case of the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System) from the terrestrial water storage anomalies estimated using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) over the 2003&ndash;2016 time period. Spatio-temporal changes in groundwater storage contrast significantly among the different transboundary aquifers. Low changes (lower than 10 km3) were observed in the Tindouf Aquifer System but they were found to be highly correlated (R = 0.74) to atmospheric fluxes (precipitation minus evapotranspiration, P &minus; ET) at annual scale. The GRACE data revealed huge water loss in the North Western Sahara and the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer Systems, above 30 km3 and around 50 km3, respectively. In the former case, the aquifer depletion can be attributed to both climate (R = 0.67 against P &minus; ET) and water abstraction, and only to water abstraction in the latter case. The increase in water abstraction results from an increase in irrigated areas and population growth. For these two aquifers, a deceleration in the water loss observed after 2013 is likely to be attributed either to an increase in rainfall favoring rain-fed agriculture or to measures taken to reduce the over-exploitation of the groundwater resources.",

Various hydrological models are deployed that include University of British Columbia Watershed Model (UBCWM) and snowmelt runoff model (SRM) to seasonal streamflow forecasts in Pakistan. Here, I assess the approach that employed snow water equivalent (SWE), temperature (T), precipitation (P), and February month flow (Feb) to forecasts Kharif (April\u2013September) season with no need for intensive hydrological modeling in a skillful way for Upper Indus Basin (UIB) at Tarbela Dam. For Indus, I compare this approach results with Indus River System Authority (IRSA), UBCWM, and SRM. This approach uses multiple linear regression (MLR) to develop regression function for forecast seasonal flow volume. This regression approach provides much skillful flow forecasts that is consistent in uncertainty spread for the Indus. The regression forecast accuracy with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 7.95% with regard to statistical approach used by IRSA, UBCWM, and SRM as 10.25%, 11.05%, and 8.91%, respectively. This approach even allows improvement of 1% (volume ~ 0.6 km3) and is very simple to apply with requirement of four input data that are easy to procure or download and process. With this information in hand, a regression function can generate seasonal forecast for the authorities in Pakistan.",

            "abstractNote": "The power law relationship between the rain (RT) and lightning flash (LF) is useful for estimating rainfall over poorly gauged catchment areas of rivers over north-east India (NEI) and that between LF and storm top height (STH) is key to lightning parametrization in models. However, they are poorly constrained over the Indian monsoon region where potential for significant changes exists with large spatial variability of rainfall, strong land-ocean contrast, seasonality and contribution of stratiform to total rainfall. Using 16\u00a0years of TRMM-PR data and LIS data, here we examine the RT and LF relationship and between LF and STH during pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons over four regions, NEI, Central India (CI), Bay of Bengal (BoB) and Indian Ocean (IO). A stronger power law (exponent b\u00a0=\u00a00.71) during pre-monsoon than that during the monsoon season (b\u00a0=\u00a00.58) apply for convective rain over land (including BoB) while a weaker relationship is applicable for stratiform rain with b\u00a0=\u00a00.60, and b\u00a0=\u00a00.47 respectively. Over IO, the relationship is nearly identical for convective and stratiform rain with no seasonality (b\u00a0~\u00a00.4). A power law poorly represents the LF-STH relationship over land and fails over IO. A fifth power law is applicable only for pre-monsoon convective rain over land weakening to half in monsoon seasons (b\u00a0=\u00a02.48). For stratiform rain it is weaker with (b\u00a0=\u00a03.27) and (b\u00a0=\u00a01.67) for pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons respectively. Our findings suggest that one threshold based lightning parameterizations are inadequate and need to be generalized to include regional and seasonal differences unraveled here.",

In particular, the water vapor transport patters shows redistribution under the influence of high mountains, which profoundly impacts the landscape of the local and surrounding areas. Based on satellite precipitation data of global precipitation measurements from 2015 to 2018, the influence of the topography on the spatial and temporal distributions of the precipitation in the TP was evaluated. The results show that the precipitation distribution is clearly affected by the topography, and decreases from southeast to northwest. Precipitation mainly concentrates in the southern foothills of the Himalayas. In the hinterland of the TP, the gradient distance increases from southeast to northwest, with value changes from 100\u202fmm / 60\u202fkm to 100\u202fmm / 150\u202fkm. The maximum annual precipitation height in the windward side of the TP (west of Tianshan Mountains, south of Himalayas, and southwest of Hengduan Mountains) is below 2000\u202fm, while in the northern and inner areas, it exceeds 4000\u202fm. The precipitation isoline in the south and northwest of the TP is consistent with the elevation contour. However, in the northeastern and interior areas, the precipitation isoline is consistent with the orientation of the mountain structural belt.",

In September 2013, the fCO2 and the sea surface salinity (SSS) decrease significantly. The high precipitation due to the presence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the propagation of low salinity waters from the Amazon River plume explain the decrease of SSS. Indeed, in fall, the retroflection of the North Brazil Current (NBC) feeds the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) and transports Amazon waters to the eastern part of the tropical Atlantic. Simulations from a three dimensional physical and biogeochemical model and observations at the mooring show that the Amazon plume reached the mooring in September 2013. The decrease of fCO2 is associated with a moderate peak of chlorophyll. Over the period of the CO2 observations, the site is a source of CO2 to the atmosphere of 0.65\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.47\u202fmmol\u202fm\u22122\u202fday\u22121. Although the wind speed is at its lowest intensity in September 2013, the flux over the whole period would be about 14% higher without this month. Every month of September from 2006 to 2017, the model simulates a decrease of dissolved inorganic carbon corresponding to the SSS minimum.",

            "abstractNote": "Past studies have shown that accurate soil moisture initialization can contribute significant skill to near-surface air temperature (T2M) forecasts at subseasonal leads. The mechanisms by which soil moisture contributes such skill are examined here with a simple water balance\u2013based model that captures the essence of soil moisture behavior in a state-of-the-art subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting system. The simple model successfully transforms initial soil moisture contents into average \u201cforecast\u201d evapotranspiration (ET) values at 16\u201330-day lead that agree well, during summer, with the values forecast by the full NASA GEOS S2S system, indicating that soil moisture initialization dominates over forecast meteorological conditions in determining ET fluxes at subseasonal leads. When the simple model\u2019s ET anomalies are interpreted in terms of T2M anomalies, a similar conclusion is reached for T2M: soil moisture initialization explains much (about 50% in the eastern half of the continental United States) of the T2M anomaly values produced by the full GEOS S2S system at 16\u201330-day lead, and the T2M forecasts produced by the simple model capture about one-half of the skill attained by the full system. The simple model\u2019s framework is particularly conducive to an analysis of uncertainty in forecasts. Drier soils are generally found to induce larger uncertainty in ET (and thus T2M) forecasts, a result linked to the functional form relating ET to soil moisture in the simple model and verified by an analysis of the ensemble spreads within the forecasts produced by the full GEOS S2S system.",

It is necessary to monitor both the vertical profile and the total column ozone. In this study, variations in the ozone concentration of Pohang were divided into three vertical layers: the stratospheric layer (STL), the second ozone peak layer (SOPL), and the tropospheric layer (TRL). Our results indicated that the ozone concentration in the STL, SOPL, TRL, and total column ozone increased by 0.45%, 2.64%, 5.26%, and 1.07% decade&minus;1, respectively. The increase in the SOPL during springtime indicates that stratosphere&ndash;troposphere exchange is accelerating, while the increase during summertime appears to have been influenced by the lower layers. The growth of tropospheric ozone concentration is the result of both increased ozone precursors from industrialization in East Asia and the influx of stratospheric ozone. Our results reaffirmed the trend of ozone concentration in mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere from vertical profiles in Pohang and, in particular, suggests that the recent changes of ozone in this region need to be carefully monitored.",

These maps are valuable for many applications and should enhance our understanding of the global precipitation patterns and trigger more research in order to explain what has not been explained. It has been found that the whole study area had a mean significant linear rate of change of \u2212 0.4 mm/year. Nearly half of its area had significant linear rates of increase with a mean of 8.5 mm/year while the other half had significant linear rates of decrease with mean of \u2212 7.6 mm/year. Landmass alone can be divided into nearly two halves; the first had significant linear rates of increase with a mean of 5.2 mm/year while the second had significant linear rates of decrease with mean of \u2212 7.0 mm/year. Water areas alone also can nearly be divided into two halves; the first showed significant linear rates of increase with a mean of 9.6 mm/year while the second showed significant linear rates of decrease with mean of \u2212 7.8 mm/year. Grouping the whole study area into six climatic zones and 21 administrative land and water regions and applying pixel-based Tukey test showed that the obtained significant linear rates of change varied significantly among these climatic and administrative regions.",

We develop an alternative method viz.,weighted water storage deficit (WWSD) to characterize drought events over Yangtze river basin (YRB) based on water storage deficit (WSD) method by combining GRACE RL06 sphere harmonic (SH) coefficient data and WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model(WGHM) data.We use component contribution ratio (CCR) of single terrestrial water compartment as weight to compute WWSD, comparing with other commonly employed drought indices and precipitation data from Global Precipitation Measurement(GPM). The results show that precipitation is the major trigger of water storage variation over YRB, which both have significant seasonal change. Our findings also indicate different terrestrial water component contributes distinctly to terrestrial water storage (TWS) variability and responds differently to drought features in YRB according to water component storage deficit (WCSD). Eleven drought events are identified in YRB based on WWSD with 2003, 2006 and 2011 experiencing the severest drought with drought intensity of -1.22cm, -1.34cm and-1.02cm, respectively. Our study suggests that it is more realistic and reasonable to treat water components unequally to construct drought index derived from GRACE.",

The original and track-error-corrected QPFs extracted from the Global Forecast System (GFS) of 52 TCs over the coastal region of China during 2015\u20132017 were compared with the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) observations. The track forecast error was corrected by shifting the QPF according to the difference between the forecasted and observed TC centers. Qualitative evaluations revealed that large track forecast error tends to cause severe under-forecast of total rainfall volume over a region. Quantitative assessments showed that the impact of track forecast error generally increases with track forecast error up to 500\u00a0km. The rapid decline of QPF skill with lead time is mainly attributed to the fast-growing track forecast error. Track forecast error has large impact on moderate to heavy rainfall and little impact on extremely heavy rainfall. Based on the assessments, a new operational post-processing method was developed to reduce the impact of track forecast error on QPFs from numerical models. The new technique was able to improve the TC QPFs in general and especially at longer lead times.",

            "abstractNote": "Accurate precipitation measurement is very important for socio-hydrological resilience in the face of frequent extreme weather events such as cyclones. This study evaluates the performance of two satellite products: the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM 3B43V7) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA, hereafter: TRMM) and the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG, Final Run V06, hereafter: GPM) in the Sultanate of Oman. Oman is an arid country that generally has few rainy days, but has experienced significant flash floods, tropical storms and cyclones recently, leading to the loss of lives and millions of dollars in damage. Accurate precipitation analysis is crucial in flood monitoring, hydrologic modeling, and the estimation of the water balance of any basin, and the lack of a sufficient weather monitoring network is a barrier to accurate precipitation measurement. Satellite rainfall estimates can be a reliable option in sparse network areas, especially in arid and semi-arid countries. This study evaluated monthly rainfall (hereafter: OBSERVED) levels at 77 meteorological stations from January 2016 to December 2018. The capacity of the TRMM and GPM satellite products to detect monthly rainfall amounts at varying precipitation thresholds was also evaluated. Findings included (1) overall and across the 11 Governorates of Oman, both satellite products show different spatial variability and performance to the OBSERVED at the monthly, seasonal, and annual temporal scales; (2) from the perspective of precipitation detection and frequency bias, GPM showed a similar performance to TRMM at detecting low precipitation (2 mm/month) but was poorer at detecting high precipitation (&gt;30 mm/month) across the entire country as well as in the Northern, Interior, and Dhofar regions; (3) both products show similarities to the OBSERVED through the partitioning of their seasonal time series into a distinct number of homogenous segments; and (4) both products had difficulty reproducing OBSERVED levels in the Dhofar and Interior regions, which is consistent with studies conducted in mountainous and coastal regions. With the aim of reproducing the spatial and temporal structure of OBSERVED in a rugged terrain, the study shows that both satellite products can be used in areas of sparse rain gauges or as additional observation for studies of extreme weather events. Overall, this study suggests that for Oman, both satellite products can be used as proxies for OBSERVED with appropriate bias corrections and GPM is also a reliable replacement for TRMM as a precipitation satellite product. The findings will be useful to the country&rsquo;s flood resilience and mitigation efforts, especially in areas where there is sparse rain gauge coverage.",

            "abstractNote": "Extreme atmospheric and surface conditions over the vast Saharan desert result in the development of one of the deepest atmospheric boundary layers (Saharan Atmospheric Boundary Layer, SABL) on the planet. The land cover in the Sahara mainly consists of wide interchanging areas of stony and sandy desert intercepted by narrower bare rock formations. Significant changes in surface albedo, surface temperature, turbulence fluxes and wind speed have been observed with remote measurement platforms like aircraft and satellites. This was a motivation to simulate the convective boundary layer (CBL) that develops over the heterogeneous Saharan surface with a two-way coupled system of a large eddy simulation code (LES) and a land surface model (LSM). Initial and boundary conditions are provided by airborne observations and mesoscale atmospheric simulations. In order to investigate the effect of surface heterogeneity on the vertical structure of the SABL, a large scale (larger than 10\u202fkm) idealized warm surface anomaly is simulated and analyzed. A land strip with a low surface albedo produces almost doubled fluxes in density and stronger convergence near the ground than over the surrounding brighter surfaces. First and second order turbulence statistics reveal that strong thermals penetrate the inversion layer above the CBL producing a vigorous exchange between unstable and overlying stable air. Furthermore, a convective internal boundary layer (CIBL) is formed over the warm strip. The downwind development of the CIBL is studied and CBL depth equations from literature are revised. The average turbulent structure of the SABL reveals flow changes locally and downwind of the surface heterogeneity (strip), which can be more significant than the dispersive fluxes due to surface heterogeneity, and may have an important effect on processes such as dust uplift and its long range transport that influence weather and climate globally.",

            "abstractNote": "Springtime biomass burning (BB) in peninsular Southeast Asia (PSEA) has a large impact on the downwind air quality as has been frequently observed at the Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (LABS). Numerous PSEA BB long-range transport events have been observed at LABS in the past decade, of which the biggest event (based on the carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratio and particulate matter (PM) loading) occurred on March 18, 2009. In this study, for the first time, in-situ observations from LABS, MERRA-2 reanalysis data, and satellite data were combined to elucidate this remarkable event. This event lasted over 29\u00a0h and seriously impacted the air quality at LABS. Average concentrations (\u00b1S.D.) of CO, ozone (O3), and PM10 were 586.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0164.5\u00a0ppb, 105.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.4\u00a0ppb, and 90.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m\u22123, respectively, which were enhanced ranging from 98% to 280% over the March 2009 average. Furthermore, significant increases in toxic air pollutants (e.g., gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) and dibenzo-p-dioxin/furan) concentrations were also observed, implying a severe impact from BB smoke on ecosystems and human health. The transport pathway and BB smoke layer height were investigated with backward trajectories, daily satellite aerosol products, and lidar observations. The mean SSA440 value of 0.87 suggested that the plume contained highly adsorbing aerosols, and the high char-EC/soot-EC ratio (low-temperature elemental carbon/high-temperature elemental carbon) of 29.4 suggested predominance of BB aerosols. In addition, plume aging indicators (e.g., \u0394GEM/\u0394CO, \u0394O3/\u0394CO, char-EC/soot-EC) suggest the BB plume was only weakly aged (i.e. low air mass intermixing, low chemical transformation, low cloud interaction) and in a nearly pristine state during the whole of the long-range transport. This event study can serve as a valuable benchmark when identifying unaged BB plumes that have been transported from PSEA to LABS (>2000\u00a0km) and will be useful for characterizing PSEA BB and its impact on greater Asia environment.",

            "abstractNote": ": Biomass burnings either due to Hazards Reduction Burnings (HRBs) in late autumn and early winter or bushfires during summer periods in various part of the world (e.g., CA, USA or New South Wales, Australia) emit large amount of gaseous pollutants and aerosols. The emissions, under favourable meteorological conditions, can cause elevated atmospheric particulate concentrations in metropolitan areas and beyond. One of the pollutants of concern is black carbon (BC), which is a component of aerosol particles. BC is harmful to health and acts as a radiative forcing agent in increasing the global warming due to its light absorption properties. Remote sensing data from satellites have becoming increasingly available for research, and these provide rich datasets available on global and local scale as well as in situ aethalometer measurements allow researchers to study the emission and dispersion pattern of BC from anthropogenic and natural sources. The Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) in New South Wales (NSW) has installed recently from 2014 to 2019 a total of nine aethalometers to measure BC in its state-wide air quality network to determine the source contribution of BC and PM2.5 (particulate Matter less than 2.5 &mu;m in diameter) in ambient air from biomass burning and anthropogenic combustion sources. This study analysed the characteristics of spatial and temporal patterns of black carbon (BC) in New South Wales and in the Greater Metropolitan Region (GMR) of Sydney, Australia, by using these data sources as well as the trajectory HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) modelling tool to determine the source of high BC concentration detected at these sites. The emission characteristics of BC in relation to PM2.5 is dependent on the emission source and is analysed using regression analysis of BC with PM2.5 time series at the receptor site for winter and summer periods. The results show that, during the winter, correlation between BC and PM2.5 is found at nearly all sites while little or no correlation is detected during the summer period. Traffic vehicle emission is the main BC emission source identified in the urban areas but was less so in the regional sites where biomass burnings/wood heating is the dominant source in winter. The BC diurnal patterns at all sites were strongly influenced by meteorology.",

            "abstractNote": "This paper examines the response of the upper atmosphere to equatorial Kelvin waves with a period of \u223c3 days, also known as ultrafast Kelvin waves (UFKWs). The whole atmosphere model Ground-to-topside model of Atmosphere and Ionosphere for Aeronomy (GAIA) is used to simulate the UFKW events in the late summer of 2010 and 2011 as well as in the boreal winter of 2012/2013. When the lower layers of the model below 30-km altitude are constrained with meteorological data, GAIA is able to reproduce salient features of the UFKW in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere as observed by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder. The model also reproduces ionospheric response, as validated through comparisons with total electron content data from the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer satellite as well as with earlier observations. Model results suggest that the UFKW produces eastward-propagating \u223c3-day variations with zonal wavenumber 1 in the equatorial zonal electric field and F region plasma density. Model results also suggest that for a ground observer, identifying ionospheric signatures of the UFKW is a challenge because of \u223c3-day variations due to other sources. This issue can be overcome by combining ground-based measurements from different longitudes. As a demonstration, we analyze ground-based magnetometer data from equatorial stations during the 2011 event. It is shown that wavelet spectra of the magnetic data at different longitudes are only in partial agreement, with or without a \u223c3-day peak, but a spectrum analysis based on multipoint observations reveals the presence of the UFKW.",

Precipitation data was obtained from weather stations available on a daily basis from the 1930s to present. A total of 143 stations were chosen and rainfall estimates performed for years 2014 through 2018. Applying the same metrics we showed how GPM performances improve as the temporal aggregation increases. Several drawbacks were detected in the coastal areas, which were characterized by lower accuracy performances than internal areas. However, the 3IMERG product could be a strong source of data to study the impact that climatic disturbances have on the hydrologic cycle in the Central and South zones of Chile. Additionally, its offers a fundamental source of data for remote zones or areas where access is complicated to install weather stations.",

            "abstractNote": "Quality satellite-derived precipitation products (SPPs) are needed for water resources inventories and management, particularly in poorly gauged regions around the world. The latest version of five SPPs were assessed against SILO (Scientific Information for Land Owners) gauge-based gridded precipitation dataset in Australia over a 5-year period from October 2014 to September 2019. The evaluation was carried out using a 0.50\u00b0 grid at daily, seasonal, and annual temporal scales. The assessed SPPs were the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) (IMERG), TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), Climate Prediction Centre (CPC) Morphing technique (CMORPH), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and PERSIANN-CDR (Climate Data Record). PERSIANN does not include any ground-based observations for bias-correction, while the other four products are bias-corrected against gauge-based data. Bias ratio and correlation coefficient for the five SPPs showed that the overall performance of IMERG and TMPA was better than that of CMORPH, PERSIANN, and PERSIANN-CDR for Australia. Seasonal analysis showed that IMERG had the better skill in winter. Overall, IMERG appeared to be the best SPP for Australia. However, TMPA also performed reasonably well, considering the climatological calibration implemented recently in the precipitation processing algorithm. The structural similarity index (SSI), a map comparison technique using a moving window-based approach, was used to compare similarities between a pair of gridded precipitation maps in terms of local mean, variance, and covariance. All the SPPs showed discrepancies in the spatial structure of the mean annual precipitation, predominantly over some high precipitation areas in Australia. These local scale differences were not detectable in conventional cell by cell comparison or simply by visual inspection. Therefore, SSI could be an effective method to evaluate satellite precipitation estimation algorithm.",

            "abstractNote": "NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) was installed on the International Space Station (ISS) on 10 May 2019. OCO-3 combines the flight spare spectrometer from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission, which has been in operation since 2014, with a new Pointing Mirror Assembly (PMA) that facilitates observations of non-nadir targets from the nadir-oriented ISS platform. The PMA is a new feature of OCO-3, which is being used to collect data in all science modes, including nadir (ND), sun-glint (GL), target (TG), and the new snapshot area mapping (SAM) mode. This work provides an initial assessment of the OCO-3 instrument and algorithm performance, highlighting results from the first 8\u00a0months of operations spanning August 2019 through March 2020. During the In-Orbit Checkout (IOC) phase, critical systems such as power and cooling were verified, after which the OCO-3 spectrometer and PMA were subjected to a series of rigorous tests. First light of the OCO-3 spectrometer was on 26 June 2019, with full science operations beginning on 6 August 2019. The OCO-3 spectrometer on-orbit performance is consistent with that seen during preflight testing. Signal to noise ratios are in the expected range needed for high quality retrievals of the column-averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which will be used to help quantify and constrain the global carbon cycle. The first public release of OCO-3 Level 2 (L2) data products, called \u201cvEarly\u201d, is being distributed by NASA's Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). The intent of the vEarly product is to evaluate early mission performance, facilitate comparisons with OCO-2 products, and identify key areas to improve for the next data release. The vEarly XCO2 exhibits a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of \u2243 1, 1, 2\u00a0ppm versus a truth proxy for nadir-land, TG&SAM, and glint-water observations, respectively. The vEarly SIF shows a correlation with OCO-2 measurements of >0.9 for highly coincident soundings. Overall, the Level 2 SIF and XCO2 products look very promising, with performance comparable to OCO-2. A follow-on version of the OCO-3\u00a0L2 product containing a number of refinements, e.g., instrument calibration, pointing accuracy, and retrieval algorithm tuning, is anticipated by early in 2021.",

            "abstractNote": "The increasing demand for water in urban areas of developing countries has been given more importance to rainwater harvesting techniques in the last decades. However, there is still a lack of general approaches to show and compare the potential to benefit effectively from direct roof runoff at different locations. Past studies mainly focused on specific design conditions, making it difficult to interpret and upscale their results in zones with similar conditions. This research explores the influence of rainfall characteristics and design parameters: storage tank size, catchment area, and daily water demand on rainwater harvesting systems designed for water supply. Sixteen locations in Ecuador with varying hydroclimatic characteristics were selected to evaluate our methodology. A mass balance method using satellite records of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission was employed to estimate optimal dimensions based on the reliability of the system. Our results suggest that locations with similar annual rainfall and seasonality have similar performances of rainwater harvesting systems. Based on that premise, regional approaches can be formulated. They can be employed as a tool to support decision-makers promoting policies related to rainwater harvesting at local and regional scales.",

Propagation of acoustic-gravity waves generated by instabilities of tropospheric fronts into the upper atmosphere is simulated. The experimental data on atmospheric pressure variations during 2016 year registered on a net of four microbarographs located in the Moscow region are processed. A case of very significant pressure fluctuations (up to 30 times larger than the average level) is selected, which were caused by an atmospheric front arrival. Observed surface pressure field variations for this field were approximated and used as the lower boundary condition for simulating the vertical wave propagation. The numerical simulations showed that just after the boundary source activation, the infrasonic waves in the upper atmosphere may have amplitudes of perturbations of temperature up to 100 K, and horizontal velocity up to 60 m/s. Internal gravity waves come into the upper atmosphere later and far horizontally away from the wave source. The influence of the limited dimensions of the computational domain on the simulation results is investigated. The conditions at the horizontal boundaries of the computational domain, which allow the runaway of waves beyond the domain are proposed. The frequency spectrum of waves in the non-isothermal atmosphere is analyzed.",

Soil moisture (SM), rainfall (RF), and land use land cover (LULC) data were analyzed to identify the climatic and anthropogenic drivers that cause vegetation changes at the subdivision scale. Principal component analysis and MK (Mann-Kendall) test showed significant greening trend over semi-arid regions of Northwest India (NWI) and South India (SI) while slight browning trend seen over some of the subdivisions in Indo-Gangetic (IG) plains and Western Ghats (WG). It is found that the NDVI has superior correlation with soil moisture compared with rainfall and the croplands (CL) found to have significant increasing trend over the NWI and SI. Increasing trend in soil moisture over the NWI and SI may have contributed to increase in CL area and the greening trend. Over IG plains, the NDVI showed moderate correlation with SM and RF, and the greening trend (browning trend) in some regions can be attributed to increase in natural vegetation mosaic (decrease of CL). The NDVI has shown browning trend over the core monsoon regions of Madhya Pradesh (an increase of barren lands over west MP and decrease of CL over east MP) and Western Ghats (significant decrease of CL over Konkan and Goa). This study revealed that the soil moisture and LULC changes are the major driving factors for the vegetation changes over majority of the subdivisions in India.",

Variations in ultraviolet B (UVB) light during seasons affects cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3. Serum vitamin D concentration influences the expression of airway surface liquid (ASL) antimicrobial peptides such as LL-37. Objective: We sought to determine the effect of seasons on serum vitamin D levels and ASL antimicrobial activity. Methods: Forty participants, 18&ndash;60 years old, were randomized 1:1 to receive 90 days of 1000 IU vitamin D3 or placebo. We collected ASL via bronchoscopy and measured serum 25(OH) vitamin D from participants before and after intervention across seasons. We measured ASL antimicrobial activity by challenging samples with bioluminescent Staphylococcus aureus and measured relative light units (RLUs) after four minutes. We also investigated the role of LL-37 using a monoclonal neutralizing antibody. Results: We found that participants, prior to any intervention, during summer&ndash;fall (n = 20) compared to winter&ndash;spring (n = 20) had (1) decreased live bacteria after challenge (5542 &plusmn; 175.2 vs. 6585 &plusmn; 279 RLU, p = 0.003) and (2) higher serum vitamin D (88.25 &plusmn; 24.25 vs. 67.5 &plusmn; 45.25 nmol/L, p = 0.026). Supplementation with vitamin D3 increased vitamin D levels and restored ASL antimicrobial activity only during the winter&ndash;spring. The increased ASL antimicrobial activity seen during the summer&ndash;fall was abrogated by adding the LL-37 neutralizing antibody. Conclusion: ASL kills bacteria more effectively during the summer&ndash;fall compared to the winter&ndash;spring. Supplementation of vitamin D during winter&ndash;spring restores ASL antimicrobial activity by increasing the expression of antimicrobial peptides including LL-37.",

Climate change impacts on GWS (groundwater storage) could affect the sustainability of freshwater resources. Here, we used a fully-coupled climate model to investigate GWS changes over seven critical aquifers identified as significantly distressed by satellite observations. We assessed the potential climate-driven impacts on GWS changes throughout the 21st century under the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). Results show that the climate-driven impacts on GWS changes do not necessarily reflect the long-term trend in precipitation; instead, the trend may result from enhancement of evapotranspiration, and reduction in snowmelt, which collectively lead to divergent responses of GWS changes across different aquifers. Finally, we compare the climate-driven and anthropogenic pumping impacts. The reduction in GWS is mainly due to the combined impacts of over-pumping and climate effects; however, the contribution of pumping could easily far exceed the natural replenishment.",

Such neo-urban spaces have inadvertently disrupted the hydrological balance both within and around themselves. As a result, tumultuous \u2018hydro-dynamism\u2019 is being faced in atmospheric and sub-surface locales of even small planned neo-urban townships like New Town, West Bengal, wherein rainfall regimes, evapo-transpiration rates(ET), land surface temperatures(LST) and groundwater levels, have been affected. Using Built-up Index to identify the spectacular urban growth, TRMM rainfall data, MODIS 11B3 LST and MODIS 16A2 ET rates have been further correlated 3 dimensionally as well as statistically, to understand the changing hydrological regime of the township for two time periods, i.e., 2001-02 and 2018\u201319. The variables were found to be significantly related, and partial aggressors for average piezometric fall. Results from average annual estimates depict that over the past 18 years of urban growth of New Town, rainfall has decreased by 10\u00a0mm(112\u00a0mm), LST has increased by 5 units(300 Celsius), while ET values have decreased by 3units(5\u00a0mm/year). Groundwater level data acquired from the Central Groundwater Board Reports, further state that other than groundwater over-extraction by the denizens, there is a 13% chance that the 4\u20136 mbgl fall may be attributed to the changing urban hydrology. Future predictions using annual average data state that rainfall will decrease to 102\u00a0mm, while LST might escalate to around 35\u201337 and 29-300 Celsius during day-time and night-time, respectively. Piezometric fall and ET rates will plummet to around 20-30mbgl and 2-0.8\u00a0mm/year, respectively, causing undue stress to neighbouring zones.",

A 3-year simulation was carried out for North America to evaluate NU-WRF-CASA's performance under various regions and environmental conditions. Observational CO2 data from tower, flask, aircraft, and satellite measurements were used for model evaluations. The results showed that NU-WRF-CASA correctly distributed CO2 fluxes and reproduced spatial-temporal CO2 transport and variability reasonably well with overall bias within 1 ppmv.",

            "abstractNote": "The present work reports atmospheric opacity at 220\u00a0GHz over Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO)-Hanle during 2006 to 2018. The opacity data were derived from the radiometric measurement of sky-brightness temperature as a function of zenith angle for every 10\u00a0min during day and night. Since the operating frequency range is not completely opaque during rainfall or cloudy atmosphere, observations are performed even during rainfall or cloudy sky conditions. The minimum opacities observed at the site varied from 0.06-0.07 at 1st quartile and 0.08-0.09 at 2nd quartile during December-January. Opacity at Hanle is linearly correlated with high temporal resolution GPS (Global Positioning System) Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) with a correlation coefficient of about 0.8. The observed median opacity at Hanle has increased by 44% during the best observing months (October\u2013March) and 24% over the annual data (October-September) with reference to the opacity observed during 2000\u20132003. Such increasing opacity trends are apparently due to effects of the dynamics of the regional and global hydrological cycle. In order to assess the impacts of the regional and global hydrological cycle, PWV obtained from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET), satellite and reanalysis data were studied at nine high-altitude astronomical observatories spread spatially across the globe such as Atacama desert in Chile, Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, Hanle and Merak in India, Ali and Yangbajing Observatories in Tibet, LLAMA in Argentina, and Dome A and Dome C in the Antarctic Plateau during 2003-2018. On an average, PWV trend over Atacama desert is increasing by 0.01 to 0.03\u00a0mm per year and at IAO-Hanle, Merak and Ali by 0.01 to 0.05\u00a0mm per year, indicating non uniform dynamic hydrological cycles. Interestingly, there is no noticeable PWV trend for the sites located in the Antarctic Plateau. During the four best observing months, PWV observed at Hanle, Merak and Ali sites have values lower than the Mauna Loa observatory by 0.14\u00a0mm and 0.56\u00a0mm at 1st and 2nd quartiles, respectively.",

            "abstractNote": "Recently, climatological and environmental researchers have paid significant attention to the long-term trends and variations in haze-related weather conditions in North China (NC). This study investigates this topic using a quantified air stagnation index (ASIE) that combines stagnation intensity with fixed emission information, given that haze occurrence depends strongly on the rate of emission. ASIE has a close spatial and temporal relationship with observed PM2.5 concentrations, and a strong sensitivity to haze occurrence in NC. The annual ASIE increased by 18.2% over the period 1980\u20132018 due to significant decreases in planetary boundary layer height and ventilation. However, there was an apparent drop during 2013\u20132018, which suggests that lower stagnation intensity may take effect on the improved air quality in NC reported in recent years. Such low-frequency oscillation occurred twice during 1980\u20132018. Hence, if the current trend of decreasing stagnation intensity reverses, haze events may become more common in the future. In addition, the interannual variations in stagnation intensity were very significant. The percentage change of ASIE was as high as 50%\u201370% in some years. Finally, using the year-to-year growth ratio of ASIE, we highlight the difficulty of the \u201cclean air challenge\u201d due to the variations in stagnation in NC. The results suggest that the enforcement of the emission reduction plan should be tailored according to the stagnation conditions in the region and period of interest.",

            "abstractNote": "Soil moisture (SM) plays an indispensable role in many practical applications, such as drought monitoring, hydrologic applications and agricultural management. Passive microwave remote sensing has proven capable of capturing changes in SM. However, the coarse spatial resolution (approximately 25\u201340\u00a0km) may greatly limit many regional hydrological and agricultural applications. In this study, we present a SM downscaling method based on the visible and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) remote sensing data toward improved spatial resolution of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM. In the proposed method, the Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), horizontally polarized Brightness Temperature (TBh), vertically polarized Brightness Temperature (TBv) and SWIR reflectance collected in Inner Mongolia from April to September 2018 and April to September 2019 are used as input data and combined with topographic information to downscale the SMAP SM L3 product from the original 36\u00a0km to 1\u00a0km. Random forest (RF) was used to link the input data and SMAP SM. Finally, 30 in situ station SM measurements distributed in Inner Mongolia and precipitation data were used to verify the downscaled SM. The results show that the correlation range of the downscaled SM and the in situ SM is 0.246 to 0.739, with an average of 0.535. The root mean square error (RMSE) range is 0.02 to 0.152\u00a0m3/m3, and the mean RMSE is 0.059\u00a0m3/m3. The ubRMSE has a range of 0.02 to 0.06\u00a0m3/m3, and the mean performance is 0.04\u00a0m3/m3. The bias ranges from \u22120.145 to 0.087\u00a0m3/m3, and the mean bias is 0.008\u00a0m3/m3. The downscaled SMAP SM can capture the spatial heterogeneity of the SMAP SM and the dynamic changes in measured soil moisture. The downscaled SMAP SM also has a high spatial correspondence with the original SMAP SM, providing more detailed soil water information than the original 36\u00a0km resolution.",

            "abstractNote": "As one of the most important crop-producing bases, the North China Plain (NCP) has suffered serious groundwater depletion due to drying climate and intensive human activities. An accurate estimation of groundwater storage (GWS) is of great importance for the sustainable development of local society and region\u2019s economy. This study investigates a methodology to determine improved GWS variation throughout the NCP based on assimilation of terrestrial water storage (TWS) data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data into the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model. We found that the CABLE model is not able to compute the prolonged decrease (and accelerated since 2013) in the GWS change around the southwestern region of the NCP where major cities are located. The model incorrectly characterizes the spatial patterns of interannual and annual changes of water storage variation, mainly caused by errors in the precipitation forcing data. The interannual TWS change is indicative of GWS, while the observed seasonal variation is primarily that of root-zone soil moisture. The GRACE data assimilation most effectively improves GWS computation. The GWS assimilation results were validated against a total of 156 in-situ groundwater level data in the NCP. Compared to the model computation, there was a significant improvement in terms of cross correlation, on average, from 0.12 (before assimilation) to 0.54 (after assimilation). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of GRACE data assimilation toward reliable estimation of ground water storage variation in the NCP, and its promise to quantify the potential implication of water supply from the South-to-North Water Transfer Project within the NCP.",

            "abstractNote": "Mapping and monitoring landslides in remote areas with steep and mountainous terrain is logistically challenging, expensive, and time consuming. Yet, in order to mitigate hazards and prevent loss of life in these areas, and to better understand landslide processes, high-resolution measurements of landslide activity are necessary. Satellite-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) provides millimeter-scale measurements of ground surface deformation that can be used to identify and monitor landslides in remote areas where ground-based monitoring techniques are not feasible. Here we present a novel InSAR deformation detection approach, which uses double difference time-series with local and regional spatial filters and pixel clustering methods to identify and monitor slow-moving landslides without making a priori assumptions of the location of landslides. We apply our analysis to freely available Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite data acquired between 2014 and 2017 centered on the Trishuli River drainage basin in Nepal. We found a minimum of 6 slow-moving landslides that all occur within the Ranimatta lithologic formation (phyllites, metasandstones, metabasics). These landslides have areas ranging from 0.39 to 1.66\u00a0km2 and long-term dry-season displacement rates ranging from 2.1 to 8.8\u00a0cm/yr. Due to periods of low coherence during the monsoon season (June \u2013 September) each year, and following the 25 April 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake, our time series analysis is limited to the 2014\u20132015 and 2016\u20132017 dry seasons (September\u2013May). We found that each of the landslides displayed slightly higher rates during the 2014 period, likely as a result of higher cumulative rainfall that fell during the 2014 monsoon season. Although we do not have high quality InSAR data to show the landslide evolution directly following the Gorkha earthquake, the similar rates of movement before (2014\u20132015) and after (2016\u20132017) Gorkha suggest the earthquake had negligible long-term impact on these landslides. Our findings highlight the potential for region-wide mapping of slow-moving landslides using freely available remote sensing data in remote areas such as Nepal and future work will benefit from expanding our methodology to other regions around the world.",

            "abstractNote": "As the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall increase, the frequency of extreme rainfall-induced landslides also increases. Thus, the importance of accurate assessment of extreme rainfall-induced landslide hazard increases. Landslide hazard assessment requires estimations of two components: spatial probability and temporal probability. While various approaches have been successfully used to estimate spatial landslide susceptibility, fewer studies have addressed temporal probability and, consequently, a commonly accepted method does not exist. Prior approaches have estimated temporal probability using frequency analysis of past landslides or landslide triggering rainfall events. Hence, a large amount of information was required: sufficiently complete historical data on recurrent landslides and repetitive rainfall events. However, in many cases, it is difficult to obtain such complete historical data. Therefore, this study developed a new approach that can be applied to an area where incomplete data are available or where nonrepetitive landslide events have occurred. To evaluate the temporal probability of landslide occurrence, the developed approach adopted extreme value analysis using the Gumbel distribution. The exceedance probability of a rainfall threshold was evaluated, using the Gumbel model, with 72-h antecedent rainfall threshold. This probability was then considered to be the temporal probability of landslide occurrence. The temporal probability of landslides was then integrated with landslide susceptibility results from a multi-layer perceptron model. Consequently, the landslide hazards for different future time periods, from 1 to 200\u00a0years, were estimated.",

            "abstractNote": "An accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for characterizing the water budget in arid and semiarid ecosystems. Although various soil moisture data have been used to improve the hydrological process modeling, only a few studies improved ET estimation at a global scale by utilizing satellite soil moisture active passive SMAP data, particularly targeting arid and semiarid areas. To address this issue, this paper proposes a process-based assimilation scheme (LPJ-SMA) to simulate daily ET at 0.25\u00b0 spatial resolution for the water limited areas. First, an integrated model (LPJ-PM) is constructed by the updated Priestley\u2013Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPLSM) and the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM). As the PT-JPLSM model establishes a connection between soil moisture (SM) and ET, the SMAP data could be integrated into LPJ-PM. Second, with the estimated ETPM (3-day interval) in LPJ-PM as \u201cobservations\u201d, the original ETLPJ (daily) estimated by LPJ-DGVM could be well constrained in a water-limited area through data assimilation. The results showed that: (1) the ETPM with SMAP information performed better and had a higher accuracy than ETLPJ. (2) After assimilating ETPM into LPJ-DGVM, the assimilated-ET (ETDA) showed a superior performance (R\u00a0=\u00a00.75, RMSD\u00a0=\u00a00.72\u00a0mm/d) to ETLPJ (R\u00a0=\u00a00.55, RMSD\u00a0=\u00a01.02\u00a0mm/d) and ETPM (R\u00a0=\u00a00.70, RMSD\u00a0=\u00a00.93\u00a0mm/d) when evaluated against in situ observations at a 95% significance level. Our proposed assimilation system (LPJ-SMA) was applied to arid and semiarid regions in the United States, and the results illustrate that the spatial distribution and annual value of the LPJ-SMA ET was very similar to NLDAS-2 ET products, which have a higher precision over North America than other global \u2018reference\u2019 products. The proposed LPJ-SMA system can be used to optimize model simulation performance and effectively improve ET prediction accuracy. This method can be used as an alternative to estimate global ET, especially in water-limited regions.",

This study examines 95 and 88 popular clear-sky irradiance models for their worldwide estimation capability of DNIcs and DIFcs, respectively. Atmospheric inputs are from MERRA-2 reanalysis and irradiance observations for validation are extracted from 100 ground stations across five major K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate zones. They consist of 24 million 1-min measurements of DINcs and 18.7 million 1-min measurements of DIFcs after quality control and clear-sky detection, during the 5-year period 2015\u20132019. Using principal component analysis, the performance of each clear-sky irradiance model is ranked separately among the five climate zones, as well as given a global rank. For the Equatorial, Arid, Temperate, Cold and Polar climates, it is found that Heliosat1-I, ESRA-I, REST2v9.1, REST2v9.1 and CLS, respectively, are the best DNIcs models, while Modified Iqbal-C, Heliosat1-R, Calinoiu, Modified Iqbal-C and PSI-REST are the best DIFcs models. On a global worldwide basis, the three top-ranking models are REST2v9.1, REST2v5 and MMAC-V2 for DNIcs, and Modified Iqbal-C, PSI-REST and MRMv5 for DIFcs. The results and rankings presented are strictly relative to MERRA-2 input data, and should not be extrapolated to results from alternate sources of atmospheric data. This detailed validation exercise revealed inconsistent performance of many models across different climates, possibly due to insufficient training and/or over-fitting of empirical relationships. Codes of all clear-sky irradiance models in the public domain are available online on the Github repository JamieMBright/clear-sky-models.",

Studying the power potential of the system at a given location requires evaluating the local power production profile of the AWE system. As the optimal operational AWE system altitude depends on complex trade-offs, a commonly used technique is to formulate the power production computation as an Optimal Control Problem (OCP). In order to obtain an annual power production profile, this OCP has to be solved sequentially for the wind data for each time point. This can be computationally costly due to the highly nonlinear and complex AWE system model. This paper proposes a method how to reduce the computational effort when using an OCP for power computations of large-scale wind data. The method is based on homotopy-path-following strategies, which make use of the similarities between successively solved OCPs. Additionally, different machine learning regression models are evaluated to accurately predict the power production in the case of very large data sets. The methods are illustrated by computing a three-month power profile for an AWE drag-mode system. A significant reduction in computation time is observed, while maintaining good accuracy.",

The ability of the LSMs to detect dry and wet events is also evaluated.\nNew hydrological insights for the region\nThe surface and root zone soil moisture of the LSMs and the surface soil moisture of the ESA CCI (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative, hereafter ESA-SM) show in general a good performance against the in-situ measurements. In particular, the BHOA (Balance Hidrol\u00f3gico Operativo para el Agro) shows the best representation of the soil moisture dynamic range and variability, and the GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System)-Noah, ERA-Interim TESSEL (Tiled ECMWF\u2019s Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land) and Global Drought Observatory (GDO)-LISFLOOD are able to adequately represent the soil moisture anomalies over the Pampas region. In addition to the LSM results, also the ESA-SM satellite estimated anomalies proved to be valuable. However, the LSMs and the ESA-SM have difficulties in reproducing the soil moisture frequency distributions. Based on this study, it is clear that accurate forcing data and soil parameters are critical to substantially improve the ability of LSMs to detect dry and wet events.",

The capability of the products in producing rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships, however, has not been examined in any great detail. The performance of four remote-sensing-based gridded rainfall data processing algorithms (GSMaP_NRT, GSMaP_GC, PERSIANN and TRMM_3B42V7) was evaluated to determine the ability to generate reliable IDF curves. The work was undertaken in Peninsular Malaysia. The best-fitted probability distribution functions (PDFs) of rainfall totals for different durations were used to generate the IDF curves. The accuracy of the gridded IDF curves was evaluated by comparing observed versus estimated IDF curves at 80 locations. The results revealed that a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution had the best fit to the rainfall intensity for different durations at 62% of the stations, and this was then used to develop the IDF curves. A comparison of these remote sensing derived IDF curves with the observed IDF data revealed that the GSMaP_GC product performed best. In general, the satellite-based precipitation products tended to underestimate the IDF curves. The GSMaP_GC IDF curves were found to be the least biased (8%\u201327%) compared to the TRMM_3B42V7 IDF curves (65%\u201367%). The biases in rainfall intensity of different return periods for GSMaP_GC for all grid points were estimated. These results can be used in designing hydraulic structures where gauged data are unavailable.",

            "abstractNote": "Particulate black carbon has a range of negative impacts on health, the environment and climate, however despite this there are relatively few long-term studies on its ambient distribution as a tropospheric air pollutant. In order to address this lack of data, to help to provide greater insight into the spatio-temporal distribution of particulate black carbon and to assess potential influencing factors, a new, permanent suburban monitoring network was established with sites in four northwest European cities: London (UK), Leicester (UK), Amsterdam (the Netherlands) and Antwerp (Belgium). We report here an analysis of the first measurements made by the network over a twenty-seven-month period (January 01, 2013\u2013April 01, 2015), alongside data from pre-existing comparator urban roadside (AURN Marylebone Road, London, UK) and rural background (AURN Auchencorth Moss, Scotland) sites. The temporal evolution of black carbon was investigated at each site, as were associations with other commonly monitored pollutants (e.g. O3, NOx, PM2.5, PM10) and wind fields. Results showed clear anthropogenic signatures across the diurnal, weekly and annual timeframes, and positive correlations were obtained between black carbon measurements and other common traffic-related pollutants, highlighting the importance of vehicle emissions as a major contributor to ambient black carbon concentration in northwest Europe. Average black carbon concentrations varied from 6.6\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm\u22123 at the urban roadside, to 0.2\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm\u22123 in the rural background, with suburban and urban background sites having average concentrations in the range of 1.0\u20132.4\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm\u22123. Wind field analysis further highlighted the importance of road traffic as a source of black carbon and demonstrated the importance of local emission sources at the various receptor locations. Statistical analysis of data between sites generally indicated a weak correlation (rs\u202f=\u202f\u22120.03 to 0.68, COD\u202f=\u202f0.32\u20130.91), further highlighting the importance of local emissions in determining ambient black carbon concentration. It was also found that black carbon comprised a significant portion of total ambient particulate matter (PM), particularly at sites with the larger traffic volumes and during rush-hour (e.g. \u223c45% of PM2.5 at Marylebone Road), however, its contribution to total PM was found to decrease on days of high pollution, indicating the importance of other PM components when air quality is particularly poor.",

            "abstractNote": "Tropical Cyclone (TC) Dahlia occurred adjacent to over the equatorial southeastern Indian Ocean during the period 26 November \u2013 3 December 2017 and was observed by the Bailong buoy, which provides in situ observations of high-frequency variations in the upper ocean environment. The diurnal sea surface temperature (dSST) variabilities during different stages of the passage of TC Dahlia are studied. The dSST variability is rather weak during the TC passing stage in contrast to the strong ranges before (0.35 \u00b0C) and after (0.57 \u00b0C) the TC. Before the influence of TC Dahlia, the dSST presented significant regular variability with a peak in the afternoon and minimum value in the morning, which is similar to the even larger range that occurred after TC Dahlia. During the passage of TC Dahlia, dSST decreased dramatically, and a uniform variation was presented due to the absence of strong heat fluxes and stirring and upwelling induced by strong winds. Further analysis through a one-dimensional mixed layer model (Price-Weller-Pinkel, PWP) indicated that the dominant elements responsible for the different dSST variations during distinct stages of TC Dahlia were shortwave radiation and surface wind, which strongly impacted the dSST evolution during TC Dahlia. The asymmetrical wind strength was responsible for the asymmetry of dSST variation.",

            "abstractNote": "This study quantified the impact of non-controllable and urban emission sources on the enhancement of ozone (O3) in the troposphere. These enhancements were investigated using data from simultaneous ozonesonde launches at Half Moon Bay (HMB), CA and San Jose (SJ), CA on eleven dates in July and August 2018. The urban O3 enhancement in the SJ vertical profile was derived by subtracting out HMB, which represents baseline O3, from the urban SJ profile. Within the planetary boundary layer (PBL), urban emissions had a large impact on SJ, as SJ O3 was 20\u201330\u202fppb higher than HMB for all dates. Above the PBL, most enhancement profiles remained close to zero, indicating little differences aloft between HMB and SJ. The two sites had strong correlation coefficients (CCs), highlighting the influence of baseline O3 on SJ. A major axis regression for all vertical levels between SJ and HMB revealed a slope of 1.00 SJ ppb/HMB ppb and intercept of 0.004\u202fppb. The percent contribution of mixing layer (ML) O3 to tropospheric O3 and tropospheric O3 to total column O3 demonstrates the predominant influence of baseline O3 on the O3 profile, even over a polluted urban region. The contribution of ML O3 was low for all dates, between 2 and 6%, whereas the tropospheric contribution was 11\u201318%. These findings emphasize the importance of baseline O3 in regions with reduced vertical mixing; polluted urban air near the surface has minimal impacts on O3 concentrations above the PBL.",

            "abstractNote": "Storage and runoff are the two fundamental surface hydrological variables of a catchment. Research studies have been focused on the storage-runoff (S-R) hysteretic relationship of a catchment and its explanation very recently, thanks to satellite gravimetry. However, a complete analysis of a hydrological process starting from recharge to runoff has not been investigated. The S-R hysteretic relationship of Yangtze River Source Region (YRSR) situated in the northeast Tibetan Plateau is also unexplored. This study aims to investigate the Recharge-Storage-Runoff relationship of this catchment using gravimetrically-derived terrestrial water storage (TWS), satellite-derived and gauged precipitation, land surface modeled and gauged evapotranspiration, and runoff data measured during 2003&ndash;2012. We found that the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of S-R relationship is 0.7070, in addition to the fact that the peak of runoff every year comes earlier than that of the storage. This finding enables us to further calculate equivalent runoff based on water balance equation using the above data, while comparing to measured runoff time series. The comparison of Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)-derived (gauge-derived) equivalent runoff against measured runoff reveals a PCC of 0.8992 (0.9402), respectively, indicating both storage and runoff are largely controlled by the recharge derived from precipitation and evapotranspiration. This implies the storage is not coupled with runoff prominently due to steep topography in YRSR unable to hold the water in the form of storage. Exceptional anomalous water storage time series in 2006 has also been investigated. We speculate that the low rainfall might partly be related to an El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation event. The low rainfall and abrupt groundwater transfer are likely to be the causes of the anomaly in 2006.",

            "abstractNote": "Water resources planning and management depend on the quality of climatic data, particularly rainfall data, for reliable hydrological modeling. This can be very problematic in transboundary rivers with limited disclosing of data among the riparian countries. Satellite precipitation products are recognized as a promising source to substitute the ground-based observations in these conditions. This research aims to assess the feasibility of using a satellite-based precipitation product for better hydrological modeling in an ungauged and riparian river in Pakistan, i.e., the Chenab River. A semidistributed hydrological model of The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was set up and two renowned satellite precipitation products, i.e., global precipitation mission (GPM) IMERG-F v6 and tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) 3B42 v7, were selected to assess the runoff pattern in Chenab River. The calibration was done from 2001&ndash;2006 with two years of a warmup period. The validation (2007&ndash;2010) results exhibit higher correlation between observed and simulated discharges at monthly timescale simulations, IMERG-F (R2 = 0.89, NSE = 0.82), 3B42 (R2 = 0.85, NSE = 0.72), rather than daily timescale simulations, IMERG-F (R2 = 0.66, NSE = 0.61), 3B42 (R2 = 0.64, NSE = 0.54). Moreover, the comparison between IMERG-F and 3B42, shows that IMERG-F is superior to 3B42 by indicating higher R2, NSE and lower percent bias (PBIAS) at both monthly and daily timescale. The results are strengthened by Taylor diagram statistics, which represent a higher correlation (R) and less RMS error between observed and simulated values for IMERG-F. IMERG-F has great potential utility in the Chenab River catchment as it outperformed the 3B42 precipitation in this study. However, its poor skill of capturing peaks at daily timescale remains, leaving a room for IMERG-F to improve its algorithm in the upcoming release.",

Seven countries and sixteen cities were selected for the analysis. Evaluation of MODIS and MERRA-2 AOD with nine stations from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD indicated spatial agreement. A new merged AOD product of MERRA-2 and MODIS (MMM) was generated. The performance of MMM not only indicated a better agreement than MODIS and MERRA-2, but also showed an efficient estimation compared to AERONET. Overall, MERRA-2 was able to quantitatively reproduce seasonal and annual AOD trends on regional scale compared to MODIS and MMM though slight differences were present in some areas. High AOD loading was mainly detected in the areas of natural mineral dust during spring and summer. Regional aerosol loading was relatively low in winter and autumn. Our results indicated that the AOD had an upward trend in the EM region during 1998\u20132018. Furthermore, AOD trend shifted from upward to downward around 2006 over all the countries. Our analysis revealed a dominance of clean maritime (42.95%) over the eastern part and the mixed type aerosols (34.93 and 49.13%) over the northern and southern parts. This suggests that the EM region is influenced by a variety of aerosols.",

            "abstractNote": "The continuous shift of shoreline boundaries due to natural or anthropogenic events has created the necessity to monitor the shoreline boundaries regularly. This study investigates the perspective of implementing artificial intelligence techniques to model and predict the realignment in shoreline along the eastern Indian coast of Orissa (now called Odisha). The modeling consists of analyzing the satellite images and corresponding reanalysis data of the coastline. The satellite images (Landsat imagery) of the Orissa coastline were analyzed using edge detection filters, mainly Sobel and Canny. Sobel and canny filters use edge detection techniques to extract essential information from satellite images. Edge detection reduces the volume of data and filters out worthless information while securing significant structural features of satellite images. The image differencing technique is used to determine the shoreline shift from GIS images (Landsat imagery). The shoreline shift dataset obtained from the GIS image is used together with the metrological dataset extracted from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2, and tide and wave parameter obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast for the period 1985\u20132015, as input parameter in machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the shoreline shift. Artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm are used as a ML model in the present study. The ML model contains weights that are multiplied with relevant inputs/features to obtain a better prediction. The analysis shows wind speed and wave height are the most prominent features in shoreline shift prediction. The model\u2019s performance was compared, and the observed result suggests that the ANN model outperforms the KNN and SVM model with an accuracy of 86.2%.",

We also analyze the atmospheric meteorological parameters: air temperature and rainfall and snowfall amounts. The statistical analysis has been carried out using diurnally averaged parameters. An increase in the air temperature is accompanied everywhere by a decrease in the surface albedo, both on a monthly scale and in daily variations. Precipitation in the form of fresh snow increases the surface albedo. On the whole over 7 years, a significant negative correlation between BC and A in April was found in Nenets Autonomous okrug and on the Gydan Peninsula. Separate years (generally diverse for different areas) are revealed when day-to-day variations in A and BC correlate within a month, again with negative coefficients. We estimated possible albedo variations due to changes in different parameters, as well as variations in albedo radiative forcing.",

Spatiotemporal variability in PM2.5\u2013AOD relationships over the eastern United States of America are analyzed using surface observations, satellite data, reanalysis data, and WRF-Chem simulations. Three primary metrics are analyzed: eta (\u03b7, the ratio of PM2.5 to AOD), the correlation coefficient (\u03c1) between daily values of PM2.5 to AOD, and hit rate (\u03b8, defined as co-occurrence of high PM2.5 and AOD). It is shown that mean daily \u03b7 exhibits substantial geospatial variability and a pronounced seasonal cycle. \u03b7 computed for 301 EPA stations ranges from 21 to 155\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm\u22123 and has a domain-wide median value of 70\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm\u22123. Larger values of \u03b7 occur in winter and fall. There is also evidence of diurnal variability in \u03b7. Lower values are derived in analyses using AOD from Terra (i.e. the morning overpass) than when AOD from the MODIS instrument onboard Aqua (i.e. the afternoon overpass). The spatial median \u03b7 from Terra is 70 vs. 93\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm\u22123 from Aqua. A majority of sites exhibit statistically significant lower values of \u03b7, \u03c1, and \u03b8 during 2013\u20132017 than 2003\u20132007, indicating a declining association between AOD and PM2.5. This has implications for the potential to use remotely-sensed AOD to generate geospatial estimates of near-surface PM2.5. The spatial distribution of \u03b7 across the 301 locations exhibits a negative dependence on planetary boundary layer height and 10\u202fm wind speed and a positive dependence on integrated humidity in lower troposphere, urban fraction, 2\u202fm temperature, and vegetation coverage. Simulations with WRF-Chem indicate model-derived estimates of \u03b7, \u03c1, and \u03b8 are highly dependent on the aerosol scheme employed but the model captures some of the spatial variability and the correct dependence of \u03b7 on meteorological and land use causes of that variability.",

            "abstractNote": "Twelve actual evaporation datasets are evaluated for their ability to improve the performance of the fully distributed mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM). The datasets consist of satellite-based diagnostic models (MOD16A2, SSEBop, ALEXI, CMRSET, SEBS), satellite-based prognostic models (GLEAM v3.2a, GLEAM v3.3a, GLEAM v3.2b, GLEAM v3.3b), and reanalysis (ERA5, MERRA-2, JRA-55). Four distinct multivariate calibration strategies (basin-average, pixel-wise, spatial bias-accounting and spatial bias-insensitive) using actual evaporation and streamflow are implemented, resulting in 48 scenarios whose results are compared with a benchmark model calibrated solely with streamflow data. A process-diagnostic approach is adopted to evaluate the model responses with in-situ data of streamflow and independent remotely sensed data of soil moisture from ESA-CCI and terrestrial water storage from GRACE. The method is implemented in the Volta River basin, which is a data scarce region in West Africa, for the period from 2003 to 2012. Results show that the evaporation datasets have a good potential for improving model calibration, but this is dependent on the calibration strategy. All the multivariate calibration strategies outperform the streamflow-only calibration. The highest improvement in the overall model performance is obtained with the spatial bias-accounting strategy (+29%), followed by the spatial bias-insensitive strategy (+26%) and the pixel-wise strategy (+24%), while the basin-average strategy (+20%) gives the lowest improvement. On average, using evaporation data in addition to streamflow for model calibration decreases the model performance for streamflow (-7%), which is counterbalance by the increase in the performance of the terrestrial water storage (+11%), temporal dynamics of soil moisture (+6%) and spatial patterns of soil moisture (+89%). In general, the top three best performing evaporation datasets are MERRA-2, GLEAM v3.3a and SSEBop, while the bottom three datasets are MOD16A2, SEBS and ERA5. However, performances of the evaporation products diverge according to model responses and across climatic zones. These findings open up avenues for improving process representation of hydrological models and advancing the spatiotemporal prediction of floods and droughts under climate and land use changes.",

A clear understanding of the accuracy performance of SPPs over complex terrains and its relationship with topography is valuable for further improvement of product algorithms. The objective of this study is to evaluate three SPPs&mdash;the Climate Prediction Center morphing method bias corrected product (CMORPH CRT), Global Precipitation Measurement Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals (IMERG), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B42V7 (TRMM 3B42V7) against a high-density network of 104 rain gauges over the Taihang Mountains from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017, with special focus on the reliability of products&rsquo; performance at different elevation and precipitation intensity. The results show that three SPPs slightly overestimate daily precipitation, compared to rain gauge observations, with bias ratios (&beta;) from 1.02 to 1.06 over the entire regions. In terms of accuracy, 3B42 slightly outperforms CRT and IMERG over the Taihang Mountains. As for different elevation ranges, three SPPs show better performance in terms of accuracy in low and moderate elevation (0&ndash;500 m) regions. Similar performances of precipitation detection capability can be found for three products over the whole areas, with detection scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.58. Better precipitation detecting performance of three SPPs was discovered in high-elevation (&gt;1000 m) regions. We adopted a linear regression (LR) model and Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) model in an attempt to discover the linear/non-linear relationships between SPPs&rsquo; performances and topographic variations. In the accuracy statistical metrics, the errors of 3B42 and CRT showed significantly positive correlations (p &lt; 0.01) with elevation variations. The critical success index for three products gradually increased with elevation variation based on the LR model. The correlation coefficient and probability of detection for three products showed significant non-linear trends in the LWR model. The probability distribution function for the three products in different elevation regions is similar to that over the entire regions. Three SPPs slightly overestimated the frequency of heavy rain events (6.9 &lt; precipitation intensity (PI) &le; 19.6 mm/d); CRT and 3B42 tended to underestimate the frequency of no rain events (PI &lt; 0.1 mm/d), while IMERG generally overestimated the frequency of no rain events. Our results not only give a detailed assessment of mainly current SPPs over the Taihang Mountains, but also recommend that further improvement on retrieval algorithm is needed by considering topographical impacts for SPPs in the future.",

Realistic simulations of such interactions by models are constrained due to intrinsic model assumptions. This study examines convective triggering based on soil moisture by employing a framework of coupling diagnostics called Convective triggering potential (CTP) and humidity index (HILow) to classify land regions into various feedback regimes for each season between 2005-2015. Results show that atmospherically controlled cases prevail in most of the regions for all seasons. Temporal regime probability values (TRP) suggested a dominant wet regime in southern India and a dominant dry regime in central and western India. Precipitation events triggered in wet advantage conditions were found to have larger accumulations than similar events triggered in dry advantage conditions for all the seasons. This study highlights separate seasonal regime classification and emphasizes on how potential regime hotspots vary for each season.",

To address one of the most important components of convective parameterization, vertical profile of mass flux is examined. We have compared the convective mass flux of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models during Boreal summer over the Eastern Pacific, Western Pacific and Indian Ocean with that of ERA \u2013 Year of Tropical Convection (YOTC) reanalysis dataset. The analyses suggest that most of the models overestimate the mass flux by an order over all the oceanic basins and interestingly the vertical structure also appears similar for all the CMIP5 models irrespective of ocean basins. In view of this, we state that the improper mass flux distribution in the cumulus parameterization schemes of global models need to be improved to reduce some of the uncertainties arising from the cumulus schemes of climate models which in turn impact the precipitation bias of the models.",

KLDAS soil moisture is benchmarked against three global products: the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS), and the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) satellite product. The evaluation is performed using in situ measurements for 2013-2015 and one month standardized precipitation index (SPI-1) for 1982-2016, focusing on four major river basins in South Korea. The KLDAS outperforms all benchmark products in capturing soil moisture states and variability at a basin scale. Compared to GLDAS and FLDAS products, the EAS CCI product is not feasible for long term agricultural monitoring due to lower data quality for early periods (1979-1991) of soil moisture estimates. KLDAS shows that the most recent 2015 drought event leads to highest drought areas in the Han and Geum River basins in the past 35 years. This work supports KLDAS as an effective agricultural drought monitoring system to provide continuous regional high-resolution soil moisture estimates in South Korea.",

Most fog-vegetation studies focus on individual plant scale; the relationship between fog and vegetation function at larger spatial scales remains unclear. This hinders an accurate prediction of climate change impacts on dryland ecosystems. To this end, we examined the effect of fog on vegetation utilizing both optical and microwave remote sensing-derived vegetation proxies and fog observations from two locations at Gobabeb and Marble Koppie within the fog-dominated zone of the Namib Desert. Significantly positive relationships were found between fog and vegetation attributes from optical data at both locations. The positive relationship was also observed for microwave data at Gobabeb. Fog can explain about 10%\u201330% of variability in vegetation proxies. These findings suggested that fog impacts on vegetation can be quantitatively evaluated from space using remote sensing data, opening a new window for research on fog-vegetation interactions.",

            "abstractNote": "Stresses on water systems can be quantitatively assessed through indices that account for water demand relative to water availability, e.g., the Water Supply Stress Index (WaSSI). However, as a result of adopting deterministic supply-driven approaches, limited attention is paid to the potential impacts of climatic variability on quantifying water stresses. The current study aimed to account for the impacts of inter-annual and intra-annual variability in the WaSSI stress index and to provide insights into potential opportunities for better water management practices. The results from our analysis indicate that looking only at average stresses can substantially mask the important impacts of climate variability. Louisiana, as a typical example of humid regions in the USA, is subjected to high levels of stresses (WaSSI exceeds 1.0) with higher inter-annual variability in watersheds where thermoelectric power plants exist and extensive water is used for cooling process. In addition, intra-annual variability in some watersheds shows periodicity in terms of seasonal stress distributions due to variability in surface water supply and water demand. Our analysis indicated that the stress variability grows as the median WaSSI increases but up to a certain threshold level and then the variability decreases for very high stress levels. For the annual and monthly scales, the peak variability, quantified as the width of the 2.5\u201397.5 stress percentiles, reached 68% for a median annual WaSSI of 1.00 and 100% for a median monthly WaSSI of 1.15, respectively. Various decisions related to water use and management can be driven by such variability, at both annual and intra-annual scales. Hence, these results have important implications for applied water resource studies aiming to formulate water management policies and improve water system sustainability under climate variability.",

            "abstractNote": "Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is thermodynamically expected to increase with increasing atmospheric temperature; however, the actual constraints on the intensification of ET remain uncertain due to a lack of direct observations. Based on the FLUXNET2015 Dataset, we found that relative humidity (RH) is a more important driver of ET than temperature. While actual ET decrease at reduced RH, potential ET increases, consistently with the complementary relationship (CR) framework stating that the fraction of energy not used for actual ET is dissipated as increased sensible heat flux that in turn increases potential ET. In this study, we proposed an improved CR formulation requiring no parameter calibration and assessed its reliability in estimating ET both at site-level with the FLUXNET2015 Dataset and at basin-level. Using the ERA-Interim meteorological dataset for 1979-2017 to calculate ET, we found that the global terrestrial ET showed an increasing trend until 1998, while the trend started to decline afterwards. Such decline was largely associated with a reduced RH, inducing water stress conditions that triggered stomatal closure to conserve water. For the first time, this study quantified the global-scale implications of changes in RH on terrestrial ET, indicating that the temperature-driven acceleration of the terrestrial water cycle will be likely constrained by terrestrial vegetation feedbacks.",

This has resulted in large uncertainties in current estimates. In this study, we quantify annual precipitation rates over seven Antarctic basins using a novel mass budget (MB) approach, by building on the recent Landsat based estimate of ice discharge and changes in total water storage from GRACE. The MB precipitation rates are compared with those from CloudSat, GPCP, the Arthern precipitation climatology, the GPM constellation sensors, a few popular reanalysis products, and a regional climate model for two periods: 2007-2010 and 2013-2015. The new estimates are bounded by CloudSat precipitation rates with and without adjustment for the unmeasured near surface precipitation. GPM products significantly underestimate Antarctic precipitation rate, but capture spatial variability that is valuable for bias-adjustment. We find variable performance between products at basin scale, suggesting that an in-depth regional study of precipitation rates is necessary.",
