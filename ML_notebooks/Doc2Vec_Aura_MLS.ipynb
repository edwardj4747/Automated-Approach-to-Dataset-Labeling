zenith-sky measurements of total bro at harestua norway. correlation and orthogonal regression of omi and harestua bro for the data in fig. over the rann of kutch using omi bro retrievals from an independent research product we have explored the capability of our ombro product to observe similar enhancements in other salt lakes. it is difficult to quantify o2-o2 atmospheric content from the absorption feature around 343 nm alone and its correlation with absorption bands of bro and h2co leads to spectral correlations in the course of the nonlinear least squares minimization process that are detrimental to the omi bro retrievals. 5067 aura omi data2006. omi bro shows excellent agreement with gome-2 bro with a correlation of 0. this is very different from the approach of using a single bro profile in the omi bro algorithm and can contribute to some of the bro differences. time series comparison of sao omi bro and bira gome-2 bro vcds from february 2007 to november 2008 using simultaneous nadir overpasses occurring at high latitudes around 75 s and 75 n and within 2 min between omi and gome-2 observations. pared daily mean total bro at harestua with the mean omi bro from individual footprints that contain the location of harestua site. we have performed sensitivity analysis of omi bro vcd with respect to various retrieval settings using orbit 26564 on 13 july 2009. the temporal variation of bro at the sno locations is captured similarly by omi and gome-2 bro. figure 8 shows the time series of the comparison between omi total bro and harestua total bro from february 2005 through august 2011 with the scatter plot shown in fig. this method originally developed to mitigate the effect of the south atlantic anomaly in sao omi bro h2co and oclo data products is now also being employed for gome2. stability of the retrieval under a wide range of conditions minimized correlation with clouds low fitting uncertainties consistency of omi global total column bro with published results and low noise in pixel-to-pixel retrievals was to exclude o2-o2 from the ombro v3. we recommend using the ombro product together with the operational omi so2 product to flag abnormally high bro retrievals. products developed at the sao include operational bro cl2o and ch2o that are archived at nasa goddard earth sciences data and information services center and offline o3 profile and tropospheric o3 glyoxal and h2o that are available at the aura validation data center. the spectral fitting in the sao omi bro retrieval is based on a gauss-newton nlls fitting procedure the cern elsunc procedure which provides for bounded nlls fitting. the use of a single bro profile in the omi bro algorithm will likely underestimate the actual bro. sao omi bro retrievals were performed using radiance data publicly accessible at https: doi. the dutch-finnish omi instrument is part of the nasa eos aura satellite payload. to maintain consistency with previous versions a second fitting of all omi spectra is performed with unmodified bro cross sections to derive scds and the effective amfs. until then caution is advised when using the omi bro product during elevated so2 conditions. we also used ground-based zenith-sky measurements of total column bro at harestua norway to estimate the quality of the omi bro. 2 the current operational bro product ombro version 3 contains bro vertical column densities slant column densities effective air mass factors and ancillary information retrieved from calibrated omi radiance and irradiance spectra', 'aura mls oh measurements at 0. the mls hno3 measurements indicated two enhanced regions during the 16-25 january 2005 period with a region of decreased hno3 in between. aura mls observations indicated large mesospheric increases in oh and ho2 as a result of the spes during the time period 16-21 january in the 60-85◦ n latitude band. the mls data shows that the spe increased oh significantly: values greater than 4 ppbv are observed in a substantial part of the area poleward of 60◦ n geomagnetic latitude. 5 do indicate a somewhat larger peak oh change when compared with mls observations. mls provided measurements of two hox constituents oh and ho2. here an average mls hno3 for the period 1-14 january 2005 before the first spe was subtracted from the mls hno3 for 16-29 january 2005 in the 60-82. also mls shows decreased hno3 between 40 and 100 hpa. both the mls measurements and waccm3 predictions indicate similar areas of enhanced oh as a result of the spes. such measurements are somewhat noisier than the oh observations however mls ho2 does indicate enhancements above background levels due to the january 2005 spes. hno3 measured by both mls and mipas increased in the upper stratosphere during 16-23 january when compared with 1-14 january 2005 however waccm3 predictions indicated only minor enhancements in the same time period and altitude range. as for oh and ho2 an average of the waccm3 b realizations sampled with the mls ak was used for o3 in fig. daily averaged o3 changes from aura mls measurements and waccm3 b average predictions for the 60-82. 3 o3 besides these two hox constituents mls also measures o3. 1 the aura mls oh measured enhancements due to the spes at 0. fairly substantial oh enhancements are shown in the mls measurements and waccm3 predictions for the 16-23 january period. 5◦ n however no mls measurements are available in the band 82. a mean hno3 for the period 1-14 january 2005 was subtracted from the aura mls observed and waccm3 b average predicted values for the plotted days. daily averaged ho2 changes from aura mls measurements and waccm3 b average predictions for the 60-82. we thus used these first two weeks to construct an average quiescent oh profile for both mls and waccm3 respectively. 2 the mls instrument additionally provides ho2 measurements during the january 2005 period. we have analyzed mls hno3 measurements in a similar manner to klekociuk et al. no mls measurements are available at 82. although there is reasonable agreement between waccm3 and mls the model predictions indicate a slightly deeper penetration of the spe-caused o3 depletion signal. what is the reason behind the measurement and model h2o2 differences? since the oh and ho2 predictions are higher than the mls measurements it does follow that h2o2 would likely be overestimated given the major production reactions. demonstrated hno3 enhancements in aura mls measurements as well as global model computations as a result of the january 2005 spes. daily averaged oh changes from aura mls measurements and waccm3 b average predictions for the 6082. the waccm3 predictions do indicate a somewhat larger amount of oh change when compared with mls observations. the mipas hno3 observations show similarities to the mls data on 27-28 january for pressure levels less than 9 hpa and more than 15 hpa however there is not an indication of the region of decreased hno3 between 9 and 15 hpa. as with oh the waccm3 predictions indicate a similar time frame for the ho2 atmospheric perturbation when compared with mls observations. we thank nathaniel livesey shuhui wang and herbert pickett of the aura mls team for help in utilizing the mls measurements and application of the mls averaging kernels to waccm3 output. we compare the mls oh measurements and waccm3 model predictions for 16-23 january 2005 in the latitude band 60-82. daily averaged hno3 change: aura mls measurements envisat mipas measurements and waccm3 b average for 16-29 january 2005 in the 60◦82', \"a quantitative comparison of the analysis with omi total o3 columns is presented in fig. iasi retrieved o3 unlike mls o3 has not been used in many assimilation studies. in this study we use the omi level 3 globally gridded total o3 columns available at the giovanni web portal. 1 mls profiles the mls instrument has been flying onboard the aura satellite in a sun-synchronous polar orbit since august 2004. overall the combined assimilation of mls and iasi improves the correlations with o3sonde data for both the utls and toc columns at almost all latitudes and increases the agreement with omi total o3 column measurements. : combined assimilation of iasi and mls o3 observations 193 jul-dec 2008 bias : jul-dec 2008 standard deviation: fig. of o3 and water vapour by airbus in-service aircraft data the omi total o3 columns and several high-altitude surface measurements. in addition to the usual validation against sonde data a comparison with omi total o3 columns and free troposphere in situ measurements is reported. it is also found that the analysis is not very sensitive to the parameterization of the background error covariance due to the high temporal frequency of iasi and mls observations and the strong dependency of the o3 field on the initial condition. we thank nasa for providing mls and omi satellite o3 products. mls o3 profiles are made available in near-real time at the goddard earth science data and information services center and can be downloaded 2-4 h after the overpass of the satellite. omi doas total o3 columns agree within 2 % with ground-based observations except for southern hemisphere high latitudes where they are systematically overestimated by 3-5 %. the mls o3 product has been already assimilated in multiple models with positive effects on models' scores in the stratosphere. we conclude that the assimilation of iasi and mls data is very beneficial in combination with a linear o3 chemistry scheme. the results can be summarized as follows: globally the utls column scores are significantly better for the analysis than for the control run ; a) d) h) b) f) c) g) control run o3 aug 2008 mls analysis o3 mls+iasi analysis o3 omi o3 e) control run o3 nov 2008 mls analysis o3 mls+iasi analysis o3 omi o3 fig. 5 in this study we examined the impact of mls and iasi o3 measurements to constrain the o3 field of a global ctm by means of variational data assimilation and with particular emphasis on tropospheric o3. the initial condition and the assimilation configuration are the same as in the mls analysis but no mls data are assimilated at this point. the good quality of the utls o3 analysis with mls data confirm the findings of previous studies. 3 in the previous sections mls and iasi o3 products have been assimilated separately during august and november ) a p h ) a p h later. note that even after the exclusion of the 215 hpa mls level the analysis o3 profile between 200 and 300 hpa still differs slightly from the control run. validation of control run and mls analyses versus o3sondes: global bias normalized with the o3 climatology for august 2008 global rmse for august 2008 number of o3sonde profiles used for the validation same as but for november 2008. validation of model total o3 columns versus omi measurements: control run average o3 column for august 2008 mls analysis for august 2008 mls+iasi analysis for august 2008 omi measurements for august 2008 the same plots but for november 2008. the mls o3 profile accuracy is the lowest in the utls with biases that can be as high as 20 % at 215 hpa whereas the precision is about 5 % elsewhere. however the addition of iasi toc permits reaching the best agreement between the analysis and omi data in the tropics where the stratospheric column amount is lower and the total o3 column is more sensitive to the tropospheric amount. in its first implementation it was based on a 3d-fgat formulation which was used in numerous studies on continental or global scales for the assimilation of mls or iasi o3 data. the lowermost level of mls o3 data was found to increase the analysis bias in the troposphere and is not further used. the greatest positive correction originates from the assimilation of mls data which modifies the more abundant stratospheric o3. 2 of the mls o3 product is used in this study. these results confirm the findings of a number of already cited studies that assimilated mls o3 with other models. 3 omi total columns the omi onboard the aura satellite is a nadir viewing imaging spectrometer that measures the solar radiation reflected by earth's atmosphere and surface. the following cases were considered where the nonspecified parameters are kept as in table 1: temporally constant background variance expressed in o3 concentration units and derived from the mls ensemble above the tropopause and from sonde validation in the troposphere ; control run d) fig\", 'the validity of the o3 or water vapour values from aura mls is limited by uncertainty thresholds which are described in the data quality document for each species. please note that the o3 field of aura mls was not used for nudging the sd-waccm model run. the vertical resolution of the o3 profiles of aura mls ranges from 3 km in the stratosphere to 6 km in the mesosphere. 5 an atlantic streamer was detected in stratospheric o3 observations of the space-based microwave radiometer aura mls and the ground-based microwave radiometers gromos and somora in switzerland. another reason is the limited longitude sampling of the aura mls limb sounding observations since two subsequent orbits of aura are spaced by about 24 in longitude. the water vapour distributions of aura mls and sd-waccm are in a good agreement. the timing of the streamer event on 4 december 2015 and the global structure of the atlantic streamer agree well for aura mls sd-waccm gromos and somora. the structures of the atlantic streamer in the pure aura mls o3 fields are quite similar to those in the sdwaccm o3 fields. secondly the limited horizontal and temporal sampling of the aura mls observations may render a clear detection of streamers and filaments. finally we like to compare the water vapour distribution of sd-waccm with the observations of the satellite experiment aura mls on 4 december 2015. the relative uncertainties of gromos somora and aura mls are about 10 %. the profiles of aura mls and sd-waccm are not folded with the averaging kernels of gromos since we do not like to degrade the vertical resolution of the o3 profiles of aura mls and sd-waccm. the level2 data of aura mls consist of atmospheric vertical profiles with a spacing of 165 km. indicated that the relative differences between somora and aura mls are less than 10 %. generally the streamer is clearer in the sd-waccm simulation than in the aura mls observations. the aura mls level2 data are available at the aura validation data center. however in the aura mls observations the water vapour filament figure 5. the vortex erosion region over the caspian sea is unclear in the case of aura mls. we thank the aura mls team and nasa jpl for the microwave limb sounding measurements and the provision of the level2 data set at the aura validation data center. waccm simulation of the formation and the decay of the atlantic streamer is confirmed by the aura mls observations in fig. figure 5b shows the result of aura mls at 8. the limited temporal sampling of the aura mls maps seems to not be critical. the next step is to derive the vertical o3 profiles of gromos sd-waccm and aura mls above or close to figure 2. 3 hpa on 4 december 2015 observed by aura mls. 3 hpa are clearer in the sd-waccm simulation than in the aura mls observations. the gromos observations are indicated by the blue lines the sd-waccm results are given by the red lines and aura mls is shown by the green lines. the present study utilizes aura mls data of the version 4. thus the vortex erosion region is a bit undersampled by aura mls so that the vortex erosion and the filaments are clearer in the sd-waccm simulation than in the aura mls observations. this filament is also present in the observations by aura mls. this layer thickness of 15 km is given by the full width at half maximum of the o3 peaks of the difference profiles of sd-waccm aura mls and gromos at the right-hand-side of fig. o3 reaches a maximum of 9 ppm at 37 km altitude with gromos and a maximum of about 8 ppm at the same altitude with sd-waccm and aura mls. 2 the mls is an instrument on board the nasa aura satellite which was launched in july 2004. the global o3 maps of aura mls were computed by interpolating the valid o3 profiles of 1 day to a horizontal grid using a delaunay triangulation. it remains open as to whether this is a substantial difference between the simulation and the observation since the spatiotemporal sampling of aura mls is limited particularly the sampling in longitude which is about 24 while the sampling in latitude is about 1. the double-peak structure in the difference profile of sd-waccm is confirmed by the aura mls observation. the graphs and are based on all valid o3 profiles of aura mls measured during the days 1 4 and 8 december 2015', 'time series of august mopitt co at the 700 hpa level and mls co at the 215 hpa level for the six regions shown in black in fig. the monthly mean ch4 fields come from a gmi chemistry and transport model simulation which uses prescribed zonal mean surface concentrations. among the regions mapped here the tropical atlantic shows the highest average co values as well as the highest 2016 co values in both mopitt and mls observations. figure 9 shows box-and-whisker plots of the mean; minimum; 25th 50th and 75th percentiles; and maximum in monthly mean august co for each region over the 2000-2016 period for mopitt and 2004-2016 for mls. we use satellite observations of co from mopitt and mls and aot from modis to assess whether august 2016 the period sampled by atom-1 is typical or atypical in the context of iav in the satellite record. the mls which flies on the aura satellite provides useful observations of co down to 215 hpa beginning in 2004. and includes assimilation of o3 measurements from the omi and mls and aerosol optical depth as well as meteorological variables. boxes show the 25th 50th and 75th percentile values; whiskers show the minimum and maximum values; black triangles show the mean value; and red circles show the 2016 value for the mopitt co column the gfed4 co emissions mopitt co at 700 hpa and mls co at 215 hpa. mopitt and mls show that co in the lower and upper troposphere respectively were below average in august 2016 compared to the satellite record for august for most of the regions sampled by atom-1 but not usually the minimum year. co is lost by reaction with oh using fixed monthly oh fields archived from the gmi ctm. although mls data overlap with atom only at the highest flight levels mls and mopitt provide complementary views of co in the upper troposphere lower stratosphere and lower troposphere respectively. in contrast mls shows that 2016 co in the upper troposphere was much lower than average near the 25th percentile. in contrast both modis aot and the mopitt co column show above-average values for the tropical atlantic in 2016. furthermore aot shows a clear peak in 2009 in several of the regions whereas mopitt data are missing for august 2009 but mls shows a minimum or no anomaly. mls also shows moderately low co in the upper troposphere over alaska in august 2016. using satellite observations of 700 hpa and column co from the measurement of pollution in the troposphere instrument 215 hpa co from the mls and aerosol optical thickness from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer we find that co concentrations and aerosol optical thickness in august 2016 were within the observed range of the satellite observations but below the decadal median for many of the regions sampled. the measurement of pollution in the troposphere instrument which flies on the terra satellite provides co observations beginning in 2000', 'we use mls observations to test whether gas‐phase hno3 depletion detected by mls is consistent with populations of large nat particles detected by mipas. mipas has spread out in the same region and a population of large nat particles is detected coincident with local gas‐phase hno3 depletion detected by mls. the onset of widespread psc formation and hno3 sequestration is detected by mipas and mls in early december 2011. the mls and mipas observations in the arctic winter 2011 12 clearly show fast and extensive sequestration of gas‐phase hno3 within only a few days and coincident formation of widespread populations of large aspherical nat particles. extensive gas‐phase hno3 sequestration measured by mls and condensed hno3 inferred from the mipas spectra of 10 ppbv or more exceed model simulations for different arctic winters by up to one order of magnitude. furthermore we assess the extent of gas‐phase hno3 sequestration using the mls data and thereby constrain the maximum possible amount of hno3 condensed in the detected populations. mls gas‐phase hno3 observations at approximately 22 and 20 km. the space‐borne mls is capable of measuring gas‐phase hno3 in the presence of pscs. for the reference simulations the corresponding gas‐phase equivalent hno3 mixing ratio at 20 km is indicated for comparisons with the mls data. finally we estimate condensed hno3 from mipas observations and compare with that inferred from the mls gas‐phase hno3 observations. the left and middle columns of figure 2 show mls gas‐phase hno3 observations at the pressure levels of 31 hpa and 46 hpa. all gasphase equivalent hno3 mixing ratios estimated from the mipas spectra are in keeping with hno3 depletion seen in the complementary mls data', '', 'the mls observations of 100 hpa h2o greater than 8 ppmv in this 2-month period are shown by the white circles. aura mls shows a seasonal maximum in h2o over conus in july and august. michael schwartz and william read provided aura mls data and statistical analysis. aura mls h2o has 0. the histogram of aura mls h2o in fig. the

2-month period from july to august 2013 water greater than 8 ppmv was measured only nine times over north america three times near the west coast of mexico and once over the caribbean sea. used aura mls observations to conclude that circulation plays a larger role than ot in controlling mid-latitude stratospheric h2o in the nam monsoon region. while the aircraft samples in situ water in a thin trajectory through the atmosphere aura mls provides a larger-scale context. limb measurements from aura mls come from a 200 km path through the atmosphere with 3 km of vertical resolution in the lower

simultaneous aura mls retrievals also demonstrate a west-to-east h2o gradient on this day. some measurements exceed the threshold for enhanced h2o of 8 ppmv for aura mls and the campaign-wide mean plus 2 standard deviations for jlh mark2 9. despite the relatively dry conditions of summer 2013 there was sufficient enhanced water to be clearly observed in the aura mls retrievals. mls observations over conus are at 14:10 local time plotted as a fraction of the observations in each potential t range. nevertheless enhanced lower stratospheric h2o was observed by mls in 2013 as a rare but detectable event. satellite retrievals of h2o from aura mls provide a larger-scale context. given uncertainties in back trajectories goes under-sampling and the fact that many ots can be located in close proximity to one another we are not able to make a direct connection between an individual ot and a stratospheric h2o plume observed 1 day or more later. 2 aura mls measures 3500 profiles each day of h2o and other atmospheric species. vertical profiles of in situ h2o measurements from jlh mark2 and mls retrievals of h2o. from the mls histogram the frequency of 100 hpa h2o > 8 ppmv was 0. both jlh mark2 and aura mls h2o exceed the thresholds for enhanced h2o. the 2-month mean map of aura mls v4', 'uars mls data obey the model at least as well at mid-latitudes as in the tropics with a well-known shift toward higher r due mainly to isentropic transport of moist air from lower latitudes. because of decreasing ts and h2o mixing ratios data are available from lower altitudes than in the tropics which limits the applicability of gps but also means that mls should be more reliable at the lowest levels. 1 except using data from the uars mls for the upper troposphere. 2-3 show similar tropical results from uars and eos mls respectively. at 464 the uars mls deviates from the model but in a way opposite in character to that at 316 hpa with one skewing to high r and the other skewing to low r. also no bimodality was found in the distributions; we find only a dry mode in pr peaking at r ≈ 0. jiang for providing the uars mls data to chi ao for performing the diffraction correction and to ron mastaler for processing the gps data. the successor to this instrument eos mls is carried on the aura satellite launched in late 2004. since both versions of the mls h2o retrieval are logarithmic negative values cannot occur. mls the original mls instrument flew on board the uars satellite observing microwave limb emission useful for detecting a variety of trace species. the impact of retrieved t in the eos mls was checked by recomputing results using ncep ts; the difference was found to be small compared to uars-eos differences', 'mls co is shown as black dashed line. the mls data for co in the tropical stratosphere clearly demonstrate that qbo drives the dominant variabilities with high correlation. the phase shift of 4 months between the model and mls co mixing ratios is consistent with the corresponding shifts of 7 months between the qbo index and model co and of 11 months between the qbo index and mls co. the photochemistry of co in the stratosphere and mesosphere evaluated from observations by the mls on the aura satellite. the correlation coefficient between mls co and qbo is 0. this work is primarily motivated by the mls

vertical resolution of ~4 km and horizontal resolutions of ~6 and 400 km cross and along track in the tropical region respectively. we thank the mls project for the co data and jpl for support of this work. we do not have a good reason for the phase shift of 4 months between the model and mls co mixing ratios but we notice four things. the aura satellite on which the mls instrument is aboard was launched on 15 july 2004. figure 5a shows the qbo signal for co from mls along with the qbo index. we present detailed comparisons between model co qbo and co data from mls in figures 4-6 at 15 hpa. normalized mls data for co. pointed out that the model simulations underestimated the mean co amount and solar cycle variations of co by a factor of 3 compared to those obtained from mls observations. in this case the correlation between the model and mls co mixing ratios decreases to 0', 'therefore in order to compare o3 profiles of gromos with mls an averaging kernel smoothing is applied to the o3 profiles of the satellite data. 2 the mls is a passive microwave limb-sounding radiometer onboard the nasa aura satellite. moreover the winter enhancement of nighttime mesospheric o3 is observed by gromos and mls above bern. 5 stratospheric and middle-mesospheric o3 profiles for the period from july 2009 to november 2016 recorded by the ground-based instrument gromos and by the space-based instrument mls were used to perform a comparison and to evaluate the diurnal variability and its amplitude the ndr. to analyse the variability in mesospheric o3 we have used o3 vmr measurements coincident in space and in time recorded by gromos and by mls for the time period from july 2009 to november 2016. mean o3 profiles recorded by gromos mls convolved and mls original for the time interval between july 2009 and november 2016 are shown in the left sections of both the daytime and nighttime panels. 3 that during nighttime gromos measures more o3 vmr than mls except for the lower stratosphere where mls measures more o3 vmr than gromos both during the daytime and nighttime. 2 aura mls level 2 data can be found in livesey et al. time series of averaged daytime and nighttime o3 vmr measurements of gromos and mls for the period from july 2009 to november 2016 at different pressure levels. scatter plots of coincident o3 vmr measurements of gromos and mls for the period from july 2009 to november 2016 at different pressure levels. the scatter plots of averaged daytime and nighttime o3 vmr measurements of gromos and mls are shown in fig. the a priori profile of o3 vmr required for the retrieval is taken from a monthly varying climatology from ecmwf reanalysis as far as available and extended above by an aura mls climatology. for an overview of the differences between coincident profiles the average over daytime and nighttime values of the o3 vmr time series of gromos and mls are displayed in fig. nevertheless in the mesosphere gromos measures more o3 vmr than mls both during the daytime and nighttime. figure 3a and b show the mean o3 profiles of the collocated and coincident measurements of gromos mls convolved and mls original during the daytime and nighttime respectively. the standard product for o3 is derived from mls radiance measurements near 240 ghz. gov aura data-holdings mls index', 'figure 10 shows the sequence of daily maps as in figure 1 for the gridded co concentrations from mls. here we investigate this variability using co measurements from the mls instrument. the spatial variability of the anticyclone in terms of pv is reflected in chemical tracer fields as shown here for co observed by the mls instrument. co data are obtained from the aura mls instrument. we further utilize measurements of co from the aura mls satellite instrument to figure 2', 'other observations of upper tropospheric relative humidity from an earlier version of the mls instrument on the upper atmospheric research satellite launched in 1991 have been used to study h2o feedback processes. we do not compare airs and mls in the stratosphere because airs reported stratospheric h2o is at best able to reproduce the mean climatology of a region and period. are used to validate mls h2o under very dry stratospheric conditions. in summary figure 6 indicates remarkable agreement between airs and mls h2o measurements at 250 hpa except when mixing ratios are near the airs sensitivity limit of 15 20 ppmv. other studies have compared airs total precipitable water lower tropospheric h2o and t profiles with observations from a variety of correlative data sources regionally and globally. agree with airs to ±25% with no discernable bias at 300 hpa. figure 8 suggests that airs may be underestimating the 200 hpa h2o for wettest scenes so that regions of supersaturation noted by gettelman et al. mls may be less sensitive to the very wettest conditions at 300 hpa in figure 3 especially over the convective regions where mean h2o is 400 ppmv or greater and the mls h2o signal may reach saturation. importantly changes in estimated feedback strength will be proportional to the changes in the logarithm of the mls h2o. a retrieval algorithm inverts observed radiances from airs and amsu to vertical profiles of t minor gases and h2o along with cloud amount cloud top properties and surface properties. examination of scatter plots of airs and mls 150 hpa h2o supports this conclusion. the infrared radiances provide most of the information for the airs utwv retrievals with the amsu microwave observations primarily constraining the airs total h2o. time-zonal means of the average airs and mls h2o mixing ratios from matched mls and airs retrieval pairs by latitude and month in 2005. observed microwave radiances from mls are inverted to profiles of t gph cloud ice and several minor gases including h2o from the upper troposphere into the stratosphere. this reflects the tendency for airs to relax to climatology under very dry conditions an effect most pronounced in the lower stratosphere where airs has no skill except in the mean. the poleward and upward decreases in h2o have implications for airs sensitivity. for a discussion of the effects of cloud type on airs h2o sampling. 5 h2o retrievals publicly available at the goddard spaceflight center daac through http: mls. the remaining third of unsuccessful mls retrievals is a consequence of upwelling microwave radiances from h2o being scattered from larger ice particles of diameters greater than 200 mm. so the rms differences seen at 300 hpa in figure 4b are most likely due to mls overestimation of h2o for the wettest conditions. the airs vertical resolution comes from the large number of h2o co2 and other constituent spectral lines in the airs spectra. both mls and airs retrieve t minor gases and cloud properties along with h2o mixing ratios. the earth observing system mls operating since july 2004 on the aura spacecraft observes microwave

ground-based sensors; a 12 of 17 9. no validation studies have addressed airs utwv over the poles though gettelman et al. airs lower stratospheric h2o values may be misleading because their means and those from mls may differ by only a few percent while the correlation between airs and mls stratospheric h2o is zero to high statistical significance. however the amplitude of that change will be modified with mls h2o at 316 hpa as transmissivities are corrected in later data versions. similarly the 150 hpa h2o is primarily 20 ppmv or drier suggesting airs is insensitive to prevalent conditions at 150 hpa. the airs experiment in operation since september 2002 on the aqua spacecraft utilizes a combination of infrared and microwave radiances observed near nadir to retrieve mixing ratios from the surface to the upper troposphere. hsb improves the h2o retrieval capability of the airs system but ceased operating in february 2003 some eighteen months before the launch of mls. preliminary comparisons of airs and global positioning system retrieved t profiles show tropopause log-pressure altitude agreement to within about ±0. this high correlation suggests that both airs and

altitude as derived from mls mea 7. median differences between gloria and in situ and aura mls measurements with the median absolute deviation for each flight and the whole campaign. due to the lower vertical resolution of mls hno3 measurements they are more influenced by air masses at higher altitudes and small structures cannot be resolved. aura mls data are available at the goddard earth sciences data and information services center. for this reason no comparison of gloria and aura mls h2o measurements is shown. an overview of these gridded mls hno3 and o3 horizontal distributions is shown in fig. this interpolation method does not provide meaningful comparisons of h2o because tropospheric h2o is likely to vary significantly within the time range of aura mls-measured profiles which are selected for this type of interpolation. ent spatial resolutions of the gloria and the mls data both hno3 distributions show relative minima and maxima at the same locations and the absolute values are on the same order of magnitude. along the flight track local minima in mls hno3 are observed above the norwegian sea and south of iceland. this is explained by the fine structures which are visible in the gloria measurements but not resolved in aura mls data due to their lower vertical resolution and horizontal gridding. the aura mls instrument is a successor to the mls instrument on the

mls which is an effect of lower vertical resolution of the spaceborne instrument and horizontal gridding. the comparison of gloria o3 to the mls distributions interpolated to the gloria geolocations shows very similar large-scale structures in both data sets. this difference in spatial resolution explains lower absolute hno3 in mls compared to gloria. local maxima in mls hno3 and o3 are present

capacity to carry out accurate o3 reanalyses when the mls instrument is phased out. given its good accuracy mls o3 has been widely used both for trend analysis and assimilation experiments. we did benefit from past experiences using mocage iasi and mls o3 to define a first guess of b and we tried to further derive an optimal parameterization for this study. we acknowledge eumetsat for providing iasi l1c data woudc for providing o3sondes data and the nasa jet propulsion laboratory for the availability of aura mls level 2 o3. the biases of mls o3 profiles are typically within 5 % with respect

issues related to the a priori dependence and examine if uv assimilation could replace mls when assimilated jointly with iasi and provide similar performances in the stratosphere. the cloud fraction is based on a combination of the eumetsat l2 product and a brightness t analysis at 11 and 12 μm to fill pixels with missing avhrr data. since the sensitivity of iasi tir measurements to o3 is not uniform along the atmospheric column we also investigate the impact of assimilating more accurate stratospheric profiles from the mls in combination with iasi radiances. since version 3 of mls

departures from the true o3 profile. these results remind us that the information brought by limb sounders like mls into the da system remains essential to improve upper stratosphere o3. we compared the rmse of mlsa mls c l1a and mls c l2a computed against o3sondes to evaluate if the joint assimilation improves the overall o3 distribution. 2 since 2004 the mls has been flying on board the

demonstrating that assimilating accurate stratospheric profiles remains essential for o3 reanalyses. we can conclude that mls corrects most of the errors introduced by iasi assimilation in the stratosphere but no particular synergy is observed in the case of mls and l1 assimilation in the troposphere. since radiosoundings do not provide a uniform global coverage and vertical coverage is also lacking in the vicinity of the o3 maximum we validated the three simulations against mls measurements. 7 o3 c surface skin t 43 pressure levels mls c o3sonde global climatology mls c o3sonde

sage ii o3sondes and lidar measurements for the pre-1997 and post-1997 periods at mohp. however this can have a small impact on the o3 trends found from sage ii data presented in section 4\", 'moreover new data on the ho2 distributions were recently obtained from the mls measurements. the offline retrieval product the alternative data set of daytime ho2 has recently become publicly available at https: mls. averaged spectra have a better signalto-noise ratio which removes many of the limitations of the mls standard product for ho2. about 3000 single profiles of each chemical component fall into one bin during a month of mls aura observations. ho2 data were seen as the day-minus-night difference as prescribed by the mls data guidelines. p 2 3 t mls. performed the offline retrieval of daily zonal means of ho2 profiles using averaged mls radiances measured in 10 latitude bins. we used the latest version of the mls “standard” product for trace gas concentrations and t t within the 1-0. this operation eliminates systematic biases affecting ho2 retrievals but limits the studied latitude range to the one where mls observes both daytime and nighttime data. first clearly the distributions of < ohret > and < oret > are in good qualita3 tive and quantitative agreement with the initial mls aura measurement data at lower altitudes below 0', \"3 du is due to o3 explicitly added to the z06 product based on recent evaluation of omi and mls stratospheric column offset differences for september 2004 to december 2006. the interpolation of mls data onto the omi grid to generate the residual implicitly forces smaller-scale variability seen in the omi total column o3 to be part of the tropospheric column. finally during the course of our computations we generate a quality flag which indicates points with high reflectivity anomalous total column o3 low tropopause omi l2 flags or other problems. we use the omi-toms algorithm for the total column and mls v1. omi is a nadir-scanning instrument that detects backscattered solar radiance to measure column o3. in z06 aura mls stratospheric column and omi total column o3 data were used to produce a monthly mean and daily tropospheric o3 residual. 's comparison of omi column o3 with ground stations shows no persistent bias suggesting that the problem lies with the mls stratospheric column. about two and a half years of o3 data have been archived as level 2gp for mls and level 2 gridded and level-3 for omi beginning in september 2004. the second advantage is that because aura is in a sunsynchronous orbit aura mls instrument can produce near global maps of stratospheric column on a daily basis. the omi and mls instruments onboard the aura spacecraft have been providing global measurements of total column o3 and stratospheric column soon after the launch of aura on 15 july 2004. at the target time the mls o3 data are interpolated onto a map at the geos-4 resolution 1 1. omi total o3 measurements have been extensively validated with both ground-based brewer and dobson data earth probe toms data and sbuv 2 data. it is not surprising that the ttor is not very sensitive to surface values because omi has low sensitivity to surface o3 due to strong rayleigh scattering and surface o3 variability tends to have a smaller spatial scale than the omi pixel size and thus is not well correlated. column or a low bias with the omi o3 column. it is important to recognize that mls vertical resolution is 2 3 km so that when there is a sharp o3 gradient at the tropopause as occurs during winter mls may incorrectly estimate the stratospheric column. one advantage of the aura mls over the previous uars mls instrument is that aura mls was designed to retrieve o3 in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere. to summarize the mls stratospheric column may be slightly high biased by a few du and if the omi column has almost no bias the ttor will be low biased. up until the launch of aura and envisat near simultaneous stratospheric column and total column o3 amounts were not available. we generate the residual by subtraction of the stratospheric column from the omi total o3 column. the dutch-finnish built omi instrument is part of the nasa eos aura satellite payload. there are at least three approaches to increasing the stratospheric column resolution: mls data can be trajectory mapped to form a higher-resolution field; mls o3 can be pv mapped assuming that there is a high correlation between pv and o3 in the lower stratosphere pv becomes a surrogate for o3 ; and mls data can be assimilated in a 3-d chemical model. this is probably due to the fact that mls with its 3 4 km weighting function and lower precision in the lower stratosphere cannot resolve the steep o3 gradient at the midlatitude tropopause. mls o3 profiles precision percentage uncertainty increases moving from the stratosphere downward into the upper troposphere. found that tes total o3 column was high biased with respect to omi column. total o3 column has been accurately measured by the toms instrument series starting in late 1978 and most recently the dutch-finnish omi on aura. provide validation results on

various instruments have been used to derive the stratospheric column including sage ii uars mls and aura's earth observing system mls. 46 215 hpa tend to be within about 1% of column amounts calculated from sage ii but mls tends to overestimate o3 in the very lower part of the stratosphere by up to 20% compared to sage ii and poam data. 5 o3 shows that mls lower stratospheric o3 is slightly high biased to sage ii and poam. comparisons between omi and ground-based total column o3 measurements indicates that omi column o3 is within 1% of the ground-based measurements. the aura mls instrument can be used to estimate the stratospheric column as in z06. total o3 from omi is derived using the toms version 8 algorithm. a possible explanation for this is that the synoptic product generated by the simple subtraction of mls stratospheric column from omi total column o3 cannot account for the dynamic variation of the tropospheric column at extratropical latitudes\", 'mean jja

because the mls data have correlated with local convection as illustrated both by the better quality at 147 hpa than at 215 hpa. based on mls co observations the highest co concentrations in the northern hemisphere ut occur in summer when deep convection reaches peak intensity. the ut co observed by mls thus includes a clear imprint of asian anthropogenic pollution in the global circulation

we redefine the airs h2o concentrations as a geometric mean quantity between adjacent pressure levels. this is because the limb geometry of mls senses through a large amount of atmosphere for a given

extra10 tropics for pressures as low as ∼260 hpa or perhaps to lower pressures in moister conditions with discernible vertical thermal gradients. as will be shown this sharp drop in information content occurs for all airs h2o retrievals throughout the 25 tropics and extra-tropics. also apparent are local maxima over land due to convective uplift airs and mls h2o sensitivity c. in fact from 170 hpa to 83 hpa the kernel peak distribution does not change much at all indicating that airs has little to no sensitivity to h2o in this region of the atmosphere. the average lv from 407 hpa to 260

pres20 sures below 260 hpa the verticalities still indicate airs has some sensitivity to h2o depending on mixing ratio and local t lapse rates; this will be discussed in more detail in sect. what we have done is develop a method that takes advantage of the overlapping vertical sensitivity of airs and mls and the typical smoothly varying nature of h2o in the utls. the airs h2o profiles are kept

distribution of dq178 for airs might resemble that of the joined profiles one needs to remember dq represents a relative percent change in the h2o lapse rate which only measures the smoothness of the

and midnight. the detailed statistical study of about 2300 o3 differences of aura mls and somora gave the following results: the temporal fluctuations in the o3 time series of somora and aura mls over payerne are coherent in amplitude and phase. the stripes are stronger during time intervals of high o3 variability suggesting that the stripes are not produced by instrumental calibration errors of

instruments aura mls haloe and ace-fts to allow us to compare a dense uniform sampling pattern characteristic of limb emission sounders to the coarse nonuniform sampling patterns characteristic of solar occultation instruments. for example for the occultation sensors the t maximum sampling biases are about 10 k compared to 1 k for mls. figure 1 shows the zonal mean h2o field at 100 hpa as sampled by each instrument to highlight how much daily variability may be missed by the haloe and ace-fts sampling patterns. also at 1 hpa the pressure level at which the strongest t trend was found in cmam30-sd an mls sampling pattern will require 15 years to detect this particular trend while the haloe and ace-fts sampling will require 25 and 30 years respectively. aura mls was launched in 2004 and measures limb millimeter and submillimeter atmospheric thermal emission using heterodyne radiometers covering spectral regions near 118 191 240 and 640 ghz and 2. root-mean-square sampling bias for 2005 as a function of latitude and pressure for t o3 and h2o as measured using mls haloe and ace-fts sampling patterns. this resolution is comparable to the horizontal resolution of haloe ace-fts and mls which is limited by the 500 km limb-viewing path length and hence no smoothing of the model fields is necessary. for example at 1 hpa the pressure level where the strongest t trend is found in cmam30-sd a 15-year record of mls-sampled observations would be required to detect such a trend at the 95 % confidence level while haloe and ace-fts sampling would require 25 and 30 years respectively. since haloe does not measure co we assumed the same error as given by clerbaux et al. overall mls sampling allows the estimation of the trend magnitudes to about 1 order of magnitude better than haloe and acefts sampling with accuracy better than 1 % at most pressure levels for t and co and better than 10 % for o3. haloe was launched on the uars in 1991 and it measured infrared spectra across eight broadband and gas filter channels from 2. right: zonal mean h2o at 100 hpa as sampled by mls haloe and ace-fts for individual days. for example for near-global t trends at 10 hpa haloe and ace-fts sampling patterns artificially bias the trend estimates by about 10 and 25 % respectively. for o3 at 2 hpa the pressure level where the strongest o3 trend is found in cmam30-sd the mls sampling pattern would require about 11 years while haloe and ace-fts would require about 20 and 30 years respectively', 'height profiles of water vapour vertical ascent rate computed using aura mls data over asian american and african regions. a good agreement between aura mls vertical ascent rate and era-interim vertical velocity is observed for pressure levels lower than 82. the presence

agreement with the mls observations during winter. to summarize we find that ttl t variations alone cannot explain the seasonal cycle of h2o at 100 hpa in mls observations over the nh subtropics 10-40 n. 2ice model produce boreal summer and autumn h2o values in the 10-40 n range which is much closer to the geosccm and mls. to compare with the mls we averaged the trajectory h2o fields in the vertical using the mls averaging kernels following the instructions from livesey et al. during jja the cloud model increases the 100 hpa h2o values over the asian monsoon and north american monsoon regions but there is still an underestimation compared to the mls. the geosccm reproduces the hemispheric asymmetry seen in the mls observations and shows that during jja the 100 hpa h2o maxima are located over the asian monsoon and north american monsoon regions. these caliop iwc data obtained between may 2008 and december 2013 are then monthly averaged onto the same horizontal and vertical grids as were used for the mls data. we use a lagrangian trajectory model to analyze the seasonal cycle in observations of h2o made by the mls as well as simulated fields from the goddard earth observing system chemistry-climate model. the mls h2o retrieval has a vertical resolution of about 3 km in the ttl with a precision at 100 and 82. both the mls and geosccm show that the h2o seasonal cycle in the ttl has a hemispheric asymmetry with a maximum seasonal cycle between 10 and 40 n despite the fact that the ttl t seasonal cycle is symmetric about the equator. 2 level 2 h2o retrieved from the earth observing system mls instrument on the aura spacecraft. the h2o observed by mls is available at https: mls. mls h2o we analyze here version 4', \"mls and omi column so2 in dobson units for part of an orbit on 11 august 2008. the agreement between mls and omi is reasonable for rabaul manam and montserrat where the so2 profile peaks at 68 or 100 hpa. designs for a future mls-like instrument provide for viewing directions at a number of angles to the orbit track allowing for global coverage at a resolution of 50 km; such an instrument would combine the advantages of mls with those of nadir-sounding instruments and would be particularly valuable for the study of volcanic so2. 8 the mls instrument on aura has observed enhanced so2 mixing ratios following a number of volcanic eruptions of various sizes. its presence means that the mls v2 data can not currently be used to study any seasonal cycle which might exist in the non-volcanic so2 background. figure 1 also suggests that the daily zonal mean mls so2 mixing ratio is not quite zero. 8 du scatter in mls columns calculated in the same manner in the absence of volcanic so2 and are almost certainly due to the

for the latitude range 9 to 16 n. the readme file supplied with the omi data states that the stl data are to be used when studying explosive volcanic eruptions where the so2 is placed in the upper troposphere or lower stratosphere and that differences in actual centre of mass from 17 km produce only small errors. it is some days after the eruption before mls observes any volcanic so2. the mls column value will always be a partial column as the instrument can not observe so2 at altitudes below the 315 hpa level. 1 hpa u d 2 o s n m u l o c i m o 6 4 2 0 ● 2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 −2 0 4 6 mls column

retrievals from mipas and ace-fts for comparison. this may be because there are significant amounts at altitudes below 215 hpa where the mls sensitivity to so2 is reduced or zero. all of the observations are to the east of the volcano; the upper level winds were presumably westerly at all altitudes at which mls observed any volcanic so2. some of the smaller ones are not obvious; detection was confirmed by a combination of independent reports of an eruption and co-located observations of enhanced so2 by the omi instrument. most mls estimated profiles including so2 are reported on pressure levels spaced at six levels per pressure decade a spacing of approximately 2. as a tool for studying the dispersion of volcanic so2 mls has both advantages and disadvantages over other currently operating satellite instruments. 7 although the progress we have made in validating the mls so2 data is limited the results so far are encouraging in that the measurements agree well with omi and total masses of so2 estimated from the mls data are in line with values previously published by a variety of authors. where the mls so2 profile has a clear peak above the background noise the points are shown with an extra symbol corresponding to the pressure level at which the peak occurs. the algorithm used to derive total column so2 from omi measurements is described by yang et al. the data plotted when there is no volcanic so2 observed are not typical values or daily average values either for the mls data or for the real background so2. we therefore estimate the error in the mls partial columns by calculating the standard deviation of the partial columns in a region or day not affected by volcanic so2. as the useful so2 measurements from mls are at 10 km or above we compare them only to the stl product from omi. on 7 august 2008 the so2 mixing ratio as observed by mls was very small compared to the measurement noise. and the evolution of the so2 plume as observed by omi is described by krotkov et al. we show the time series of mls observations of elevated so2 in fig. the total column so2 calculated from the mls profiles agrees well with the total column reported by the omi instrument under the right circumstances. so2 is not a standard ace-fts data product but an experimental so2 data set has been produced. the mls instrument aura was launched in july 2004 and the mls instrument has operated with little interruption from august 2004 to date. further validation from in situ measurements is not straightforward as for most of the time and at most places there is not sufficient so2 for mls to detect. : volcanic so2 from mls 316. for nabro most of the so2 observed by mls is at 100 and 147 hpa where we would expect the mls observations to be reasonably good.

figure 14. for grímsvötn this is unsurprising as most of the so2 observed by mls is at 316 and 215 hpa; it seems likely that a fraction of the plume was at rather low altitudes where mls would be unable to observe it. table summarising mls observations of so2 during various volcanic eruptions\", \"the results for n2o and hcl are derived from both mls satellite measurements and the slimcat

composite map of caliop cirrus cloud fraction and mls h2o at 100 hpa averaged over 5 yr of the nh winter months december january and february on the top and the nh summer months june july and august on the bottom. another reason could be the influence of convection due to the limited vertical resolution of mls h2o. mls h2o is retrieved from 316 hpa to 0. aura mls data have a more uniform sampling

the predicted gems results for stratospheric o3 profiles and columns using high vertical resolution o3 profiles made by mls. comparison of mls o3 profile measurements with respect to gems and omi retrievals for 10◦ latitude bins for april 2006. to retrieve o3 profiles from buv measurements. 3-7 we compare the omi and gems profiles and column o3 to mls from 215 hpa to 0. since the middle 1990s several uv visible spectrometers have been launched to continue the toms total o3 record including the global o3 monitoring experiment the scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric chartograpy the omi gome-2 and the o3 mapper profiler suite. second both omi and gems retrievals show considerable sensitivity to middle and lower layer column o3. for the lower column o3 the largest difference between omi and gems with mls is at mid-latitude: mean biases increase from −9. total coslumn o3 observations were accomplished with the successive launch of the total o3 monitoring spectrometer onboard nimbus-7 meteor3 adeos and earth probe polar-orbiting satellites. 21 hpa layer column o3 is clearly found with a correlation coefficient of ∼ 0 with mls. furthermore we directly demonstrated that the gems performance can provide the tropospheric o3 retrieval sensitivity at least comparable to omi. this illustrates that gems contains not only most of the tropospheric o3 information compared to omi but also most of the capability to separate tropospheric from stratospheric o3 columns. first we determine whether or not gems achieves all of the tropospheric o3 information that is obtainable from omi over its 270-500 nm range. comparison of gems and omi stratospheric o3 retrievals to mls measurements is presented in sect. the tropopause height dependent climatology of o3 profiles for the omi retrieval algorithm is under development by bak et al. 1 mls is on board the aura platform with omi so the effect of the spatiotemporal variability on comparisons with omi is relatively small. for comparisons the mls profiles of volume mixing ratio are converted into partial o3 columns in dobson units. the main difference in omi and gems stratospheric column o3 is found at latitude bands above 35◦ n s; gems biases are larger than omi biases by up to 4 du. direct comparisons of total stratospheric tropospheric o3 column between omi and gems. this climatology is formed from the aura mls v3. the toms and sbuv record has played an essential role in warning of the problem of o3 depletion over antarctica and in assessing the recovery of the o3 layer since the montreal protocol came into effect. overall the impact of the 270 to 300 nm spectral information on the comparison of retrievals with mls is found to be larger in the lower column o3 than middle column o3 despite the negligible difference in the retrieval sensitivity around the tropopause between omi and gems as shown in fig. in this paper we perform o3 profile retrievals using an optimal estimation-based technique from omi level 1b radiances with fitting windows within the 270-330 nm range including the omi fitting window 270-330 nm and the eventual gems fitting window 300-330 nm. 3 we use the omi o3 profile algorithm of liu et al. in order to determine whether the three independent pieces are enough to report the stratospheric o3 profiles and stratospheric column o3 we further evaluate both omi and gems retrievals using high-resolution mls v3. scatter plots of gems versus mls omi versus mls and a priori versus mls for partial column o3 at three vertical layers between 0◦ n and 90◦ n for april 2006. the average stratospheric dfs values decrease from ∼ 6 for omi to ∼ 3 for gems although the change in corresponding stratospheric o3 column retrieval errors is negligible. in order to check the differences in the tropospheric o3 columns due to the different spectral range the direct comparison of total stratospheric tropospheric o3 columns between omi and gems is performed. the total column o3 comparison shows the mean difference of ∼ 0 du at solar zenith angle greater than 40◦; gems tropospheric column o3 retrievals are negatively biased relative to omi within ∼ 2 du. however the lower limit for gems leads to a serious loss of the stratospheric o3 information compared to omi. a priori information used in this study is basically from the llm climatology derived using o3 measurements from o3sondes sage ii and uars mls. the vertical distribution of stratospheric o3 has been observed from the sbuv on nimbus 7 and national oceanic and atmospheric administration weather satellites. the differences isnystsratteosmphseric o3 prodata s files between gems and mls are comparable to those between omi and mls below ∼ 3 hpa po except with slightly larger biases and lgargeerosstacndiearnd tdieficviatneions by up to 5 %. 2 the performances for retrieving o3 profiles from omi and gems are compared with respect to the mean aks and mean relative retrieval errors in low and mid-latitude regions respectively. 6 we investigate the retrieval performance for o3 profiles from omi level 1b data using different spectral windows in order to identify the weakness of excluding measurements below 300 nm on retrievals. as the total o3 columns are mostly determined from the radiance measurements at the longer wavelengths which are in both gems and omi spectral range the similar omi gems sco retrieval performance indirectly demonstrates that the tropospheric o3 column retrieval performance is similar to that of omi. 3 mls o3 product have not been released they are not expected to differ significantly from those for the v2. s ss e based on the comparisons we conclude that gems will measure tropospheric o3 and

'the omf reduction is relatively smaller for mls hno3 than for mls o3 because of the larger observational errors. both the emission factors and the tropospheric concentrations of nox are constrained primarily in the early afternoon by omi whereas no direct observational constraint on tropospheric nox is available in the morning. the number of super-observations is shown for the omi no2 and mopitt co. in the reanalysis run the omf bias and root-mean-square error for mls o3 becomes nearly zero globally because of the assimilation. at high latitudes the surface nox emissions have only a small effect on the tropospheric no2 profiles and the observational error of the omi measurements is large in comparison with the observed low concentration. after 2010 the positive omf for mopitt co in the control run decreases in the nh and the positive omf for omi no2 increases in the nh mid-latitudes. the remaining errors could be associated with the short chemical lifetime of nox in the boundary layer as compared to the omi revisit time of roughly 1 day biases in the simulated chemical equilibrium state and the underestimation of the emission spread. in the utls the model hno3 negative bias is reduced globally in the reanalysis because of the mls assimilation. in addition corrections made to the o3 precursors emissions over the eurasian continent by omi especially over east asia were important in influencing tropospheric o3 concentration over the north pacific around 35-60 n especially in boreal spring. comparisons of global tropospheric no2 columns between the control run and the satellite retrievals in brackets and between the reanalysis run and the satellite retrievals: omi for 20052012 sciamachy for 2005-2011 and gome-2 for 2007-2012. the first row is the omf for omi no2 data second row is for tes o3 data between 500 and 300 hpa third row is for mopitt co data between 700 and 500 hpa fourth row is for mls o3 data between 216 and 100 hpa and fifth row is for mls hno3 data between 150 and 80 hpa. the analysis of surface emissions of nox and co allowed for error correlations with omi no2 and mopitt co data while those with other data were neglected. direct concentration adjustment by tes measurements in the troposphere and by mls measurements in the utls played important roles in correcting tropospheric o3 profiles. in particular the number of assimilated tes o3 retrievals decreases after 2010 through 2012 while approximately half of the omi retrieval pixels per orbit are compromised since december 2009. the larger discrepancies with respect to the sciamachy and gome-2 retrievals may be attributed to the errors in the simulated diurnal no2 variations and a bias between omi and these retrievals. 1 assimilated data sets the assimilated observations were obtained from the omi tes and mls on the aura satellite launched in july 2004 and from mopitt on earth observing system terra which was launched in december 1999. we acknowledge the free use of tropospheric no2 column data from the sciamachy gome-2 and omi sensors from www. large adjustments are introduced to the no2 concentration in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere because the mls o3 and hno3 assimilation effectively corrects the model no2 bias as a result of the correlations between species in the error covariance matrix. the mean omf bias against omi no2 is reduced with a mean reduction of about 30-60 % at the nh mid-latitudes and about 50-60 % in the tropics. the mls o3 and hno3 data assimilation effectively corrects the amount of no2 in the lower stratosphere especially for the arctas-a profile because of the use of the interspecies correlation in the analysis step and by influencing the nox = noy species in the forecast step. positive omf) of tropospheric no2 columns compared with the omi no2 data from the southern hemisphere subtropics to nh mid-latitudes an underestimation of tropospheric co compared with mopitt co data in the nh an overestimation of middle and uppertropospheric o3 in the extratropics compared with tes and mls o3 data and underestimation of middle-tropospheric o3 in the tropics compared with tes. the increased 2 for omi no2 after 2010 is associated with a decrease in the number of the assimilated measurements and changes in the super-observation error. for the omi no2 assimilation the 2 is > 1 which indicates overconfidence in the model or underestimation of the super-observation error. the analysis increments in the assimilation of omi no2 were limited to adjust only the surface emissions of nox lnox sources and concentrations of noy species. the analysis spread for o3 is about 8-12 % relative to the analysed concentration in the tropical upper troposphere at 200 hpa which is mostly determined by the assimilation of tes and mls o3 retrievals. concentrations of noy species and o3 were optimised from tes o3 omi no2 and mls o3 and hno3 observations. in addition a representativeness error was added for the omi no2 and mopitt co observations to account for the spatial resolution differences between the model and the observation using a super-observation approach following miyazaki et al. the 2 for the omi no2 was less sensitive to the choice of the inflation factor compared to that for other assimilated measurements. the figure shows an underestimation 3e 1 * 300 3e 1 * 150 3 e

in the forecast error covariance in comparison with the actual omf in 2010-2012. 3 mls o3 and hno3 the mls data used are the version 3. the omf is relatively larger in 2010-2012 than in other years corresponding to about half the reduction in the omi no2 observation', 'a variational bias-correction scheme was applied to omi sciamachy and gome-2 retrievals of total o3 columns to ensure optimal consistency of all information used in the analysis. for data assimilation of tropospheric no2 column retrievals the version 2 dutch omi no2 data product and version 2. the different reanalysis performance statistics over the arctic compared to later years is attributed to the use of early sciamachy and nrt mipas o3 retrievals which are of poorer quality than the omi mls observations which have been used from august 2004 onwards and reprocessed mipas data used from january 2005 onwards. we also acknowledge the free use of tropospheric no2 column data from the sciamachy gome-2 and omi

issues affecting assimilated omi o3 and no2; see also sect. in both cams reanalyses a change to the vertical resolution of the assimilated sbuv 2 data during 2013 had a negative impact on the consistency of multiannual tropospheric o3 time series particularly in polar regions. omi so2 data of the planetary boundary layer vertical column l2 product were used as produced with the principal component analysis algorithm. in cams-rean also tropospheric no2 columns are assimilated using observations from the sciamachy omi and gome-2 lerot et al. demonstrated increased 2 for omi no2 after 2010 associated with a decrease in the number of the assimilated measurements and changes in the super-observation error due to the omi row anomalies. assimilation of mls measurements does not noticeably influence the tropospheric o3 analysis in the tropics', 'the 2b-cldclass-lidar product classifies cloud scenarios into eight types by using vertical and horizontal cloud properties the

the nasa aura mls instrument beginning in august 2004 and october 2004 to present. the more distinct downward propagation results mainly from the later years in the time series when mls o3 is assimilated. prior to october 2004 the only o3 data assimilated by both reanalyses are retrieved partial o3 columns from the sbuv radiometers. demonstrated that the qbo signal in the sbuv o3 data

late 2004 made by the aura mls instrument. we have shown that using an n2o surrogate in trend analysis of the mls hcl time series results in a trend that is negative at all measured levels from 68 hpa

trend of 5 % decade 1 using halogen occultation experiment and scisat-1/ace fourier transform spectrometer data between 35 and 45 km from 1997 to 2008 at midlatitudes. column 4 gives the derived trend in the 190 ghz channel of mls n2o measurements relative to the 640 ghz channel during the time of their overlap. in the case we have presented we had to apply a drift correction to the mls n2o data to get the best estimate of trend. 5 that the use of n2o as a surrogate for dynamical variability reduces the uncertainty in the calculated trend for all of the pressure levels between 15 and 68 hpa where the mls data for both hcl and n2o are considered to be suitable for trend analysis. column 3 gives the hcl trend derived using mls n2o measurements as an explanatory variable. mls n2o data are available from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center. a further problem alluded to earlier in this section is that mls now uses the 190 ghz band for its standard n2o product because the 640 ghz band is no longer usable. since both hcl and n2o have concentration gradients that are acted upon by dynamical processes to create interannual variability we have used the variability of n2o concentrations determined from mls observations as a measure of the dynamical variability that should be expected in hcl concentrations. linear trend in hcl concentrations

o3 profiles from 0. gov and the mls data were provided by the data center of aura at http: avdc. the patterns of nox concentrations near the surface in the two periods are similar to the omi mls and raqast tco patterns but nox changes little between the two periods. the omi level 3 data products of total column o3 and reflectivity are used which are produced by applying the toms version 8 algorithm to omi global mode measurements. scatter plots of the omi mls versus raqast o3 columns below 147 hpa for july 1 16 2005 in three latitude bands over the usa: 25 30 30 35 35 40. the omi and mls instruments on aura enable us to generate semimonthly tco maps for the summer months in 2005 with smaller reflectivity and resolution than those given by chandra et al. moreover the aura omi is providing total o3 columns almost simultaneously. 25 grids of omi level 3 o3 data. modeling results monthly average clear-sky tropospheric o3 columns for mid-latitudes by toms and mls measurements on the uars have been reported by chandra et al. time-averaged 'tropospheric' o3 columns below 147 hpa for july 1 16 2005 derived from omi mls residuals and raqast modeling results. compared to the o3

147 hpa from o3sonde measurements and from omi mls residuals over four usa stations from september 2004 to september 2005. 'tropospheric' column o3 differences between july 1 17 and june 17 30 2005 from the omi mls residual method and raqast model. both the sondes and omi mls show the highest column o3 values in april and may. under clear-sky conditions herein defined by omi level 3 reflectivities less than 15% the o3 column below 147 hpa is then obtained by subtracting the mls 'stratospheric' column from the omi total column. the results demonstrate that meteorological conditions play an important role in the semimonthly changes in tropospheric o3 columns at midlatitudes in the usa in summer and that the changes have been captured by the omi mls observations. the objectives of this study are to derive tropospheric column o3 from the omi and mls measurements using the tor method and to interpret the variations in the derived tco using comparisons against regional chemistry and transport model results over the united states. the semimonthly clear-sky omi mls tco maps over the usa in summer 2005 for example in july 1 16 2005 show maximum o3 regions over the northwestern atlantic and over most of the eastern and midwestern states. this study therefore uses 147 hpa as an approximation to the tropopause level and mls o3 profiles are integrated from 147 hpa to 0. two weeks later from july 1 16 to july 17 31 both the oml mls and the raqast simulations show that the increases and decreases have been mostly reversed with tco decreasing over the northwestern atlantic and over the western states and increasing over the south and east coast and they are associated with relevant reversed changes in the gph at 147 hpa. however sage stratospheric o3 profiles provide global coverage only about once per month and the quality of sbuv o3 profiles deteriorates below 32 hpa. error bars representing one standard deviation are given for the omi mls column o3 when more than three omi mls residuals meet the coincidence criteria. in the summertime usa high omi mls o3 columns below 147 hpa are found over the southeastern states and the northwestern atlantic and raqast modeling results indicate they are associated with high near-surface o3 levels. the omi and mls on nasa's aura mission have been in

strong upwelling in era-i. the picture of aoa anomalies agrees well with o3 anomalies from clams simulations and mls observations albeit with a smoother pattern of changes for mls o3 anomalies in the southern hemisphere lower stratosphere. there is good agreement between clams and mls regarding the pattern of o3 variations related to el niño-like conditions with the negative o3 anomalies in the jra-55 simulations much more confined to the tropics. note that there is a factor of 2 difference in the legend in and reflecting the difference in the magnitude of the deseasonalized o3 mixing ratio between clams and mls. the patterns of enso-induced variability in the clams o3 driven by both reanalyses and mls observations agree very well though again with a factor of 2 difference in the magnitude related to the high-biased o3 variability in clams consistent with fig. additional detailed information on the quality of mls o3 in the upper tropospherestratosphere in previous versions can be found in dedicated validation papers. panel shows the 10 s-10 n deseasonalized o3 for clams driven by era-i ; clams driven by jra-55 and mls. in addition the o3 mixing ratios from clams simulations driven by era-i and jra-55 are sampled at the mls measurement geolocations to avoid sampling bias during the intercomparisons. 2 abundances mls data were produced with improved retrieval algorithms which substantially reduced the occurrence of unrealistically small o3 values at 215 hpa in the tropics observed in the previous version 2. 3 1a shows the interannual variability of the deseasonalized

most recent el niño event produces an extremely large negative o3 anomaly in the lower stratosphere inducing a record anomaly of 15 % in the tropics for mls consistent with diallo et al. the clams and mls o3 anomalies are negative in the lower stratosphere during el niño years and positive during la niña years consistent with previous studies. in the clams model this chemical relationship between co and o3 is missing which might explain the discrepancies with mls observations. the factor of 2 difference in the zonal mean magnitude between clams and mls o3 anomalies is likely due to the lack of tropospheric o3 chemistry and the o3 lower boundary condition being set to zero in clams combined with tropical upwelling being too strong and tropical-extratropical exchange being too weak in the model. the aura mls product and era-interim reanalysis data are available. latitude-time evolution of the enso impact on lower stratospheric o3 from clams simulations driven by era-i; clams simulations driven by jra-55 and mls satellite observations in percent change from the monthly zonal mean climatology derived from the multiple regression fit and averaged between 380 and 425 k for the 2005-2016 period. note that the clams o3 values are 2 times as large as the mls o3 values and this difference in the magnitude of the o3 anomalies is not due to a sampling bias. in addition the gradient in the mls and jra-55 o3 anomalies between the tropics and extratropics in the southern hemisphere is smoother than that in clams simulations driven by era-i likely due to its too strong tropical upwelling. time evolution of the tropical o3 anomalies from clams simulations sampled at the mls measurement geolocations together with mls satellite observations in percent change from the monthly zonal mean climatology and averaged between 380 and 425 k for the 2005-2016 period. the mls instrument flying aboard the eos-aura satellite is designed to measure a wide range of physical and chemical quantities including o3. we particularly thank the nasa jet propulsion laboratory the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts and the japan meteorological agency for providing aura mls product the era-interim and jra-55 reanalyses data. in the extratropical utls clams simulations driven by both reanalyses together with mls observations show a related positive o3 anomaly due to enhanced downwelling and consistent with recent studies. zonal mean distribution of the enso impact on stratospheric o3 variability from clams simulations driven by era-i; clams simulations driven by

there is a factor of 2 difference in the colour scales in and reflecting the difference in the magnitude of the o3 changes between clams and mls. 2 mls o3 data used here are not significantly different from the previous version mls observations at pressures less than 100 hpa but show less oscillatory behaviour and fewer retrieval artifacts induced by cloud contamination in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. note that there is a factor of 2 difference in the colour scales in and reflecting the difference in the magnitude of the deseasonalized o3 mixing ratio between clams and mls', 'here mls aura observations starting on 25 april 2015 are used in combination with back trajectory modeling to demonstrate that the eruption column of calbuco also delivered

sounders on board uars namely haloe and mls call the sage ii measurements into question especially given the difficulty of separating gas and aerosol extinction signatures in the near infrared with filter-based photometers in the presence of extreme concentrations of particulate matter. mls observations are well suited for detecting volcanic injection of h2o into the stratosphere for three reasons: the microwave radiances are insensitive to volcanic aerosols there is observational coverage at night and the dense along-track sampling allows for a two-dimensional retrieval which is ideal for the case of a volcanic plume where spatial heterogeneity in h2o is expected. backward trajectory from the location of the global daily maximum in h2o vmr observed by mls on 27 april 2015 at ~03:00 utc at 83 mb and on 26 april 2015 at ~04:00 utc at 68 mb. removal of h2o by condensation on falling ice could also be involved in the decrease between 25 and 26 april at 83 mb based on the mls

rapid condensation would be sufficient to explain the modest deficit in the mass of h2o inferred from the mls observations if the assumption of a 1% mass fraction for h2o is valid. contrary to kelut the mls h2o data within the calbuco eruption are of usable quality 3 days after eruption. map of h2o vmr at 68 mb from mls aura observed at two local times 12 h apart on 25 april 2015. helens eruption by virtue of being a more explosive eruption likely delivered more h2o to the stratosphere based on the 64 ± 4 ppmv observation although the sampled volume of air for this in situ measurement was of a smaller vertical extent than the mls vertical resolution by at least a factor of 2. the aura satellite was launched in 2004 bearing mls and other atmospheric composition sensors. at 83 mb the mls

used for the kimra inversion. kimra shows a larger range of atmospheric co concentrations compared to mls that is not explained by the estimates of random errors in the data and may be due to some combination of random and systematic uncertainty. previous co retrievals for winter 2008 09 and 2009 10 showed a bias with respect to mls increasing with altitude with a value of > 5 ppm at 80 km. 4 extension of the kimra data set after establishing a reliable inversion scheme through comparison with mls the kimra data set is extended in time by substituting ecmwf operational analyses model output for the ssmis t data in the inversion. 3 comparison with mls this section presents a comparison of co profiles from kimra and mls that are colocated in space and time. as a test of the validity of the kimra observing system and to create a reference data set co was first retrieved using atmospheric t information from the ssmis satellite instrument available in 2011-2014 and compared to co data from mls. ” shows the mean of the supplied mls profiles which use a constant co concentration above 0. it should be noted that while msis is used in both t data sets the time of the msis output is governed by the times for the ecmwf output and the ssmis measurements and so the high-altitude t values are not necessarily equal for the two inversion setups. richard larsson provided ssmis t data. the spectrometer used for co measurements is a fast fourier transform spectrometer made by omnisys instruments with 1024 channels and used with a bandwidth of 110 mhz to give a resolution of 107 khz per channel. t data from ssmis currently begin in january 2011 and end in june 2014. the same as but in relative units as percent of the mean of kimra and mls co profiles. the bias for the t profiles is very low below 50 km showing good agreement between ecmwf and ncep output as well as the lower-altitude ssmis data and then moves to a minimum of 4 % at 68 km. kimra measurements during the winters 2008 09 and 2009 10 have previously been used to retrieve co profiles that have been compared to satellite data from the mls aboard aura the atmospheric chemistry experiment-fourier transform spectrometer aboard scisat-1 and the michelson interferometer for passive atmospheric sounding aboard envisat. mls co profiles are retrieved up to 0. the kimra data set is extended in time by substituting ecmwf operational analyses t output in place of the ssmis data. the t input for the kimra inversions shown here includes ssmis data. the inversions utilising ssmis data are considered to be those using the most suitable available data for the co inversion as the sensitivity of kimra co profiles to atmospheric t information is strongest within the retrievable altitude range and the resulting co data set is considered to be a reference point for inversion setups using alternate input t information. the mls co profiles have a vertical resolution more than twice as fine as that of the kimra profiles: 3', 'who made an extensive comparison of waccm to an off-line retrieval of mls ho2 mixing ratio which was able to cover a larger range of altitudes than the data used here. to assess the validity of this modeling approach waccm-carma output for the run with no ho2 uptake to msps was then compared to atmospheric observations from the mls a radiometer aboard the aura satellite. second there is a paucity of aura mls measurements at very high latitudes where the impact of msps is greatest. zonal average ho2 mixing ratio as measured by the mls for january 2005. future reanalysis of aura mls ho2 measurements may facilitate a more quantitative comparison by extending the latitude range covered. this is either due to dissolution of tmi or a ho2', '2 these low o3 values are mainly located in the troposphere in the mocage o3 and in the mls o3 analyses. airs total co columns are also used for evaluation. have assimilated mls o3 data and shown the added value of data assimilation on utls o3 fields in the tropics and in the extratropics. 3 on the global scale in order to investigate the impact of data assimilation of mopitt co and mls o3 on the estimated extl. to provide a quantitative description of the impact of mls o3 and mopitt co analyses produced by data assimilation on the extl. in the global diagnostics mls o3 analyses increase the tropospheric extent of the extl distribution below the 2 pvu level showing a more intense o3 mixing from stratosphere to troposphere. these figures display the free-model run co fields and mopitt co analyses and free-model run o3 fields and mls o3 analyses. co analyses correlations show both the effect of mls o3 analyses and mopitt co analyses. mls o3 analyses extend the spread of the distribution toward tropospheric altitudes due to an increase of o3 values in the utls. two different o3 fields are provided a mocage free-model run and mls analyses; and two different co fields are provided a mocage free-model run and mopitt analyses. use the omi and mls o3 in a data assimilation experiment to discuss the improvements of data assimilation in the spatial o3 structure in the utls and the related limitations due to the model resolution. mls o3 analyses show a spread of the estimated extl distribution toward the surface which lowers its mean location closer to the thermal tropopause. this allows for us to quantify the capability of mopitt co and mls o3 assimilated fields to better estimate the chemical extl behavior from a single ste event at the regional scale to an average state of the atmosphere at the global scale. the assimilation of mls o3 profiles corrects this underestimation since the agreement between o3sonde measurements and the mls assimilated profile is better than the free-model run profile. we thank the jet propulsion laboratory mls science team for retrieving and providing the o3 mls data. these wider distributions also suggest a more intense o3 mixing produced by mls assimilation. the assimilation of mls o3 stratospheric and utls profiles and the assimilation of mopitt co tropospheric profiles started on 20 july 2007 and involve two independent runs. 2 of the mls o3 dataset. when mls o3 analyses and mopitt co analyses are used together a synergistic effect is observed. 3 mls assimilation increments that increase o3 in the lms are advected through the tropopause and then increase the o3 mixing. the mopitt instrument is onboard the terra platform and measures tropospheric co with nadir sounding. according to these previous studies mls analyses induce a more intense o3 mixing between the stratosphere and the troposphere. the estimated extl distribution is skewed toward tropopause-relative altitudes showing the capability of mls o3 analyses to accentuate the o3 signature of the ste event. we also diagnose in the next sections how the assimilation of mopitt co and mls o3 data affects the spatial extent of the estimated extl. and lea2010 shows that utls o3 fields are improved by mls assimilation and the overall effect of mls assimilation is to increase the lms o3 fields. 2 observations the mls instrument onboard aura uses limb sounding to measure chemical constituents and dynamical tracers between the upper troposphere and the lower mesosphere. it has been shown that the tropospheric o3 concentrations in mls analyses are increased due to downward transport during the ste event. in combining the information provided by mls o3 analyses and mopitt co analyses the estimated extl distribution has a more realistic shape and location. have used mls o3 and mopitt co to diagnose a ste event. the correlation coefficients between airs and modeled co and between airs and assimilated mopitt co are 0. the skewed shape of the distribution then indicates this more intense o3 mixing from the stratosphere to the troposphere in mls o3 analyses than in the free-model run. have assimilated mls o3 at low and high horizontal resolution and show the impact of data assimilation and resolution on the utls spatial structure and on the tropospheric o3 fields. assimilated mls co data to investigate the transport pathway of co in the african upper troposphere during the monsoon season. this illustrates the o3 variability following the isentropes induced by mls assimilation at tropopause altitudes. to constrain the model used in this study we assimilate o3 stratospheric profiles from aura mls and terra mopitt co tropospheric profiles into the mocage chemical transport model', 'aura mls o3 is assimilated into era-interim in 2008 the second half of 2009 and 2010-2015 while it is assimilated into merra-2 for 2005-2015. era-interim therefore provides a somewhat independent estimate of the richness of the spring o3 reservoir for 4 of the 11 mls years. we also thank the nasa gmao and ecmwf for the reanalysis data and the aura mls team for mls data and computing support. 2005-2015 march time mean o3 for

saber into nogapsalpha and studied the properties of the resulting analyses and forecasts for the period january-february 2006. this bias estimate is similar to the saber-mls differences reported in the mls t validation study of schwartz et al. the horizontal resolution of the mls t measurements in the stratosphere is about ∼180 km along track and ∼12 km cross-track. they showed that while the bias in the stratosphere was generally less than 2 k when compared to other observations at some levels there were persistent mls t biases with ∼3 k peak-to-peak vertical structure. between 10 and 1 hpa the current analysis was transitioned linearly to the cospar international reference atmosphere t climatology and the uars reference atmosphere project zonal wind climatology. global mean systematic biases between mls and saber ts have been removed to prevent the introduction of spurious t structures in the analysis. for mls ts this is problematic near the top of the analysis domain because the observation t is sensitive to ts above the top. there is some indication in mls t comparisons with other instruments that a mls warm bias exists near 1 hpa. the mls zonal-mean t was calculated using the all mls measurements within ±1 day of the forecast time', 'since o3 retrievals from mls and omi are assimilated during the das total o3 from the geos das serves to validate the

derived from the residual of omi and mls observations. omi also measures column no2 which has been used to quantify near-surface pollution and to measure trends during the aura period. mls and omi data used in figure 5 are available from the goddard earth science data and information services center as described at https: aura. on board aura are the mls which retrieves o3 profiles in the stratosphere and the upper troposphere down to 261 hectopascals and the omi which provides total column measurements', 'furthermore iwc retrievals based on identical micro-physical assumptions from odin-smr and cloudsat are also found to be in good agreement. cloudsat retrieved iwc profiles are averaged vertically and horizontally as described in sect. the spatial resolution is important when comparing iwc retrievals and the cloudsat iwc data are averaged to match the much poorer resolution of odin-smr. however this approach ensures that systematic errors between the cloudsat and odin-smr iwc datasets are correlated as much as possible. the mls and smr retrieval approaches are affected by clouds in very different ways and no obvious common impact has been identified. these data are used as a look-up table for the retrieval where cloudsat reflectivities are mapped to iwc values. over the maritime continent mean iwc is higher for cloudsat than for odinsmr. however cloud inhomogeneities are not considered to be a large retrieval issue for cloudsat and we assume that no systematic error is introduced due to cloud inhomogeneities. accordingly the error correlation between mls and smr rhi is here set to zero. multi-year boreal winter and spring iwc fields around 190 hpa derived from odin-smr and cloudsat. average rhi values derived from smr and mls were found to be in excellent agreement with the era data but all models were found for some points to deviate from these observations. a discussion for aura mls is found in read et al. aura mls and odin-smr could have a deviating sensitivity for rhi at most dry and humid conditions but there is no case where one instrument is above the other one for both passages. this value is consistent to the fact that the official iwc product from cloudsat is reported to have a bias less than 40%. 1 but shows retrieved iwc from odin-smr and cloudsat. who used data from the pr and virs onboard the trmm. 2 as for passive

the mls observations of the distribution of gas-phase hno3 as a function of tte. each averaging bin is the size of the mls along-track separation and the height between the mid-points of the pressure levels for the mls hno3 data product. 15 we present a complementary side-by-side comparison of the same observations by plotting the mls hno3 as a time series with each observation colored according to the tte or the caliop ls_index. 7 a decade of mls and caliop satellite measurements from 2006 to 2015 over the antarctic polar vortex were used to investigate the early season development of pscs and the gasphase hno3 distribution in the lower stratosphere. figure 13 shows the mls hno3 and caliop ls_index at 32 hpa for 30 days from day number 132 to 161 for the years 2006-2015. sub-visible

in an across-track orbit offset of 200 km with the mls tangent point leading the caliop nadir view by about 7. since april 2008 aura and calipso have been operated to maintain positioning within tightly constrained control boxes such that the mls tangent point and the caliop nadir view are co-located to better than about 10-20 km and about 30 s. light green shading in indicates the envelope

assuming negligible ho2 during night-time according to the mls user's guide documentation. the absolute values of ho2 agree best at 35 km but at 45 and 55 km mls and all smiles datasets agree and are slightly higher than the model simulations. a more detailed description of the clo dataset and an intercomparison with coincident profile measurements made by aura mls are provided by urban et al. note also that smr is not zero corrected for night-time ho2 measurements as mls thus a bias cannot be completely excluded. the superconducting submillimeter-wave limbemission sounder instrument was installed on the iss and used 4 k cooled superconductor detector technology to measure stratospheric and mesospheric species including hocl clo ho2 and hcl. as mentioned in the first paragraph of this

instead of the mean in each solar zenith angle bin. the amplitude of ho2 observations by smr and mls at 55 km are about 0. mipas measures similar hocl values as smiles-r band a whilst mls measures hocl values closer to smiles-r band b and smiles-o. the mls on board the aura satellite has been operating since 2004. mls measures the same spectral lines of hcl and clo as smiles. differences

the difference of clo between sunset and the reference period for offset-correction corresponding to the mls nighttime observations is consistent with the model result obtained with k1 within the

aerosol extinctions are large for both ascending and descending nodes', 'in addition o3 from the haloe climatology averaged within the latitude range ±10◦n with corresponding standard deviation is shown. nevertheless the similarity of the patterns between mls and clams with the lowest o3 values over the equator in winter and with a clear signature of the asian monsoon anticyclone in summer confirms the seasonality of transport resolved by clams. the comparison between the clams and the mls data shows that although very similar patterns are resolved by both data sets the o3 mixing ratios measured by mls are higher than the corresponding clams values. 4 the seasonality of o3 and p-o3 at θ =380 k derived from clams is compared with the 10-year climatology of the haloe. mean distribution of o3 at θ =380 k as calculated with clams and derived from aura mls observations during the winter and summer. however as shown by our previous study based on the haloe and shadoz observations of o3 and on a simple conceptual model of transport and photochemistry the observed seasonality of o3 on θ −levels with the highest values during boreal summer cannot be understood solely by photolytical o3 production in slowly rising air masses which are well-isolated from the extratropics. as in the mls data the impact of the asian monsoon on the seasonality of o3 should be noticeable in the shadoz observations in particular in those which are located downwind of the asian monsoon anticyclone. 7 the horizontal distribution of o3 at θ =380 k is shown for the winter months december to february and summer months june to august derived from the clams simulations and observations measured by the mls on the nasa earth observing system aura. followed the same arguments in order to explain the

in the annual pattern of the tropical o3 can be diagnosed for both data sets in particular the maximum of haloe o3 between july and november around the equator is reproduced fairly well by clams o3 although the absolute values are overestimated', 'over northern africa both models match the phase and magnitude of the co variation rather well except at 215 hpa where mls does not show a seasonal cycle while there is a winter maximum and a summer minimum in the models. the underestimate of co in june-july and the overestimate in december to february at 215 hpa causes the models to have a pronounced seasonal cycle while there is none in the mls data. the mls data also provide convincing evidence that the isoprene emissions in the model are too high as they are responsible for the local maximum in co at 215 hpa over south america from november to march that is present in the model simulations but not in the observations. meanwhile with the northwest propagation of the continental anticyclone recirculation of co over central africa occurs between 0 and 10◦ s contributing to the high co south of the equator in the ut as observed in the mls data. the mls co values at 215 hpa have been scaled by 0. however the geos-4 maximum in co at 215 and 147 hpa is clearly a month late compared to the mls data and in 2006 the model peak stays high for too long. using moppit co and modis fire count data. several studies discuss these transport pathways during the west africa monsoon season in the context of interpreting o3 and co observations including mls co data. thus there is a larger decrease in model co in october 2006 between 215 and 147 hpa than in the mls observations. the mls data show that the models transport co too vigorously to 215 hpa in january and february either because the harmattan winds are too strong or in addition because the convection is too strong; the mozaic data support this argument. over southern africa mls co is highest in september and october of 2005 and in august to october of 2006 with a similar pattern in the two models. while the mechanisms transporting co from the fires in northern africa in boreal winter are well understood the mls data imply that the upward transport to the ut in the model is too strong in january and february perhaps as a result of too strong harmattan winds transporting co to the itcz. as it would clearly have exacerbated the discrepancies in the simulation of mls and tes co. 3 both tes and mls are on the nasa eos aura satellite mission launched on 15 july 2004 in a near polar sunsynchronous 705 km altitude orbit with equator crossing at 1:45 pm local solar time and a 16-day repeat cycle. the color bar range for mls co is twice of that for model results because of the factor of two high bias in the mls retrieval at 215 hpa noted above. found that the constraints on tropical co sources were not self-consistent when they used mopitt airs and sciamachy data separately possibly due to the influence of different vertical sensitivities and retrieval approaches. the mls instrument is a small radio telescope installed on the front of the aura satellite. over south america mls co reaches its seasonal maximum in october in 2005 and in september in 2006. a similar co maximum is evident in the mls data at 215 hpa in 2005 except it is slightly south of the equator. neither simulation shows the prominent maximum in mls co over northern india in august that is associated with the indian monsoon as discussed in the introduction and as reported in mopitt data in kar et al. both the tes and mls data revealed problems with excessive transport of co to the eastern equatorial pacific and lofting in the itcz in august and september particularly in geos-4. the co peak from biomass burning at 147 hpa persists longer than the observed mls peak resulting from the dominant influence of slow large scale ascent in transporting this highly seasonal source in the tropical tropopause layer. in the ut with the concern over the absolute accuracy of the mls co retrievals we focus our analysis on the difference between the co maximum in octobernovember 2006 and the co base-line during the previous 18 months. both models show a similar spatial pattern to mls for the high co over indonesia and the indian ocean as it builds up from september to november in 2006 and disappears in december. 2 co retrievals with aircraft data shows that the mls co is biased high by a factor of ∼2 at 215 hpa but that the morphology is generally realistic. the global patterns of tes co are consistent with those measured by measurement of pollution in the troposphere on the nasa terra satellite. the isoprene source of co also causes the lag of the co seasonal maximum in the model ut compared to that in the mls data as shown by the tagged co results', \"thus during solstice the o3 secondary maximum shows a clear latitudinal gradient growing from summer to winter. for ace-fts because it is an occultation instrument and o3 has very large diurnal variations around the terminator in the middle and upper mesosphere we compare ace sunset and sunrise with mipas observations with solar zenith angles in the range of 88 to 92. specific production terms of the population of o3 in nighttime for 2 days typical of equinox and solstice. 5 o3 product agrees with mls measurements to within c4 % from 20 to 45 km. 3 mls the mls was launched on july 2004 on the nasa's earth observing system aura satellite. due to the larger mls o3 vertical resolution in the mesosphere we have applied mls averaging kernels and a priori information to the mipas o3. mean of the daytime o3 vmr differences in % of mipas between co-located pairs of measurements of mipas with ace-fts saber mls and smiles for spring autumn summer and winter. when compared with ace-fts mipas o3 is significantly smaller near 80 km. 6 we have compared mipas v5r_o3_m22 o3 retrievals with co-located measurements from saber gomos mls smiles and ace-fts. the validation performed in comparisons with saber gomos mls smiles and ace-fts shows that mipas o3 has an accuracy better than 5 % at and below 50 km with a positive bias of a few percent. latitude-altitude cross sections of mipas ma daytime o3 its vertical resolution and single profile noise error for solstice and equinox. global mean of the daytime o3 vmr differences in percent of mipas between co-located pairs of measurements of mipas with ace-fts saber mls and smiles. this is likely the effect of the known positive bias of ace-fts o3 in this region. mls o3 has generally indicated 5-10 % agreement with other datasets in the stratosphere. thus during solstice the o3 nighttime secondary maximum shows a latitudinal gradient growing from summer to winter\", \"5 do not affect omps lp ability to accurately and precisely derive o3 signals associated with natural variability. for omps lp we show two o3 climatologies: one is sub-sampled to match with mls measurements and another with osiris. this figure once again demonstrates how well omps lp and mls measurements agree in describing the o3 seasonal cycle. the positive drift in o3 between omps lp and mls is on the order of 0. because the original omps lp o3 retrieval algorithm has been simplified in the version 2. 5 o3 25-30° s 500 5 0 -5-510 0 -550

different sampling. our analysis shows that omps lp retrievals accurately characterize the vertical o3 distribution in different atmospheric regions which are most sensitive to changes in the stratospheric composition and dynamics. our analysis revealed subtle systematic errors in measured radiances not seen in calculated radiances which were computed with the gsls radiative transfer model using the omps lp retrieved o3 profiles. most of the observed uncertainties in omps lp o3 retrievals are related to remaining errors in instrument calibration and altitude registration. mls measures

profiles. showed that ace-fts o3 retrievals typically agree within 5 % in the middle stratosphere and exhibit positive biases of 10-20 % in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere. 5 % yr 1 in the lp o3 record against mls and osiris that is more pronounced at altitudes above 35 km. found that the aura mls o3 data record is stable with no significant drifts in the middle stratosphere. our study also shows that ace-fts overestimates o3 in the upper stratosphere compared to lp but biases between lp and ace-fts exceed 20 % above 50 km. from the beginning of the omps mission and until june 2017 the climatological profiles were scaled at each iteration based on the o3 values retrieved at the previous step at the level 5 km below the normalization altitude. figure 12 shows the mean o3 profiles and o3 variability relative to the mean as a function of latitude for omps lp mls and osiris. figure s1 in the supplement shows o3 differences between omps lp and ace-fts as a function of the distance between the measurements. to validate omps lp o3 retrievals we use osiris data between april 2012 and june 2017. in this study we analyze o3 profiles on the lp native coordinate system which requires units conversion for mls and ace retrievals. individual o3 retrievals for omps lp and ace-fts are illustrated in fig. for the omps lp the first version of lp o3 retrievals was released soon after the beginning of operational observations in april 2012. the goal of this study is to evaluate the omps lp o3 dataset check our estimates of the systematic errors and isolate and characterize observed errors that cannot be fully explained by the known systematic errors. because ace-fts is a solar occultation instrument and makes measurements during sunrise and sunset and osiris makes measurements at 18:00 local time they are expected to measure larger o3 concentration than the instruments that observe o3 during the daytime. no unit conversion or vertical scale interpolation is needed for the osiris data that are retrieved as number densities on the same altitude grid as omps lp. 5 is expected to significantly improve the omps lp o3 product in the utls region compared to version 2. 5 o3

indications of cirrus clouds from claes extinction measurements. the accuracies of the aura mls version 2', 'since aerosol loading throughout the sage iii lifetime is very low there remains the potential for small anomalies in the aerosol extinction coefficient product related to inhomogeneity in the quality of the cross section data particularly at wavelengths where the o3 cross sections are small but o3 absorption still significantly contributes to the total optical depth. there are larger differences below 15 km in a region where it is known that haloe v19 h2o tends to be too large. sage iii h2o values above 45 km show a systematic high bias and we do not recommend them for science applications. 4 spacecraft ephemeris data figure 14 shows a 1-week average of northern hemisphere sage iii h2o mixing ratio from the beginning of the mission to the end of 2005. 4 we have examined the sage iii aerosol extinction coefficient and h2o data sets and shown them to be suitable for science applications subject to some minor caveats. finally sage iii h2o data quality in 2002 for seven day periods starting with julian days 258 300 and 321 is reduced by deficient ephemeris data and should be avoided. the sage ii h2o product was primarily dependent on a single ∼30-nm wide channel located in the ρσ τ h2o absorption band. in june 2008 version 4 sage iii data products were released including the initial release of a h2o data product. unlike sage ii given the low aerosol loading in the stratosphere throughout the mission lifetime we do not currently limit the sage iii h2o data utility in the stratosphere by aerosol loading. an evaluation of sage iii version 3 lunar occultation o3 no2 and no3 data products can be found in wang et al. we do not recommend using sage iii h2o data in these time periods. sage iii transmission between 90 and 100 km for one channel in the h2o absorption band along with the mean transmission in this layer. this takes on added significance due to the correlation between sage ii and haloe h2o measurements. in this altitude range the mean difference with all four corroborative data sets are no bigger than 15% and generally less than 10% with exceptional agreement with poam iii and mls. for sage iii a conscious effort was made to mitigate issues that had a deleterious impact on sage ii h2o data quality. profile of the mean difference between sage iii version 4 h2o mixing ratio with sage ii poam iii haloe and mls. sage iii h2o data does not appear to be affected by aerosol loading in the stratosphere. unlike sage ii we do not see a

values are increasingly too large and should be used cautiously or avoided. the sage iii h2o product below 45 km shows a general agreement with sage ii mls haloe and poam iii. in addition we show comparisons with other space-based h2o measurements including those by sage ii poam iii the haloe and the mls. for sage iii a number of aerosol extinction channels have no corresponding measurement from any other instrument. that effectively removes a slight oscillation in the mls h2o data between 20 and 25 km. 3 the sage iii h2o absorption band is relatively weak in the stratosphere and the

accuracy could be as good as 3% to 4%', \"as seen in figure 6 tco from combo ctm and omi mls tco agree within a few du and have similar basic features which include a seasonal shift in maximum o3 in the northern hemisphere extending from tropical and subtropical latitudes in spring months to midlatitudes in summer smallest year-round o3 amounts in the tropics and also high southern latitudes and a large annual cycle in tco in the southern hemisphere in the subtropics around 30 s with maximum values in september november. introduction significant improvement in alleviating some of the problems associated with the use of sbuv or uars mls. who identified the stratospheric ''tape recorder'' in co a seasonal oscillation in tropical lower stratospheric co due to transport from the upper troposphere in the aura mls data. an measured by the toms important issue for the tor method involving independent instrument. the sbuv many of the current techniques for deriving tropomeasurements have difficulty in retrieving o3 in the spheric o3 are based on the tropospheric o3 residual lower stratosphere below the o3 number density peak method which derives tropospheric column o3 and while uars mls may be extended by subtracting concurrent measurements of stratodown to 100 hpa in o3 profile measurements this limits spheric column o3 from total column o3 maps of sco to mostly tropical and subtropical latitudes. for mls there are two data quality flags and a profile precision number for screening data; the retrieval errors can include several factors including problems associated with optically thick clouds in the troposphere which may affect retrieved o3 profiles. summary one year of daily tropospheric o3 derived from aura omi and mls measurements were evaluated for spatial and temporal variations and compared with the global modeling initiative's combo ctm. omi mls our first evaluation of tropospheric o3 from omi and mls is to examine one complete year of monthly means for september 2004 to august 2005 and characterize basic properties including annual variability and regional patterns. instrument and sco is the omi and mls instruments on board the aura measured by the mls instrument. although the omi version 8 o3 algorithm accounts for aerosols the differences between omi mls and the model may still be associated with errors in the omi retrievals in the presence of desert dust. provide early validation results on the aura mls version 1. for omi the version 8 algorithm includes an error flag for screening out scenes for high solar zenith angle surface glint so2 contamination and several other factors. global omi mls tco averaged between 60 s is 60 n is largest for june august than other months of the year because of the photochemical production of o3 from both anthropogenic pollution and biogenic vocs and nox. more than a year of aura omi and mls o3 data have been archived as level 2 and level 3 data beginning in august 2004. total o3 from omi

o n a l o z o n e s o n d e s in the tropics and world o3 and ultraviolet radiation data center outside the tropics. however comparing omi mls tropospheric o3 with sparse o3sonde measurements outside the tropics is difficult in the subtropics midlatitudes which are associated with large day-to-day variability of tropopause height. the validation of omi mls tropospheric o3 includes comparisons with o3sondes in the tropics and extratropics. overview of data mls and omi are two out of a total of four instruments on board the aura spacecraft which is flown in a sunsynchronous polar orbit at 705 km

mls tropospheric and stratospheric o3 begin first by comparing mls sco with omi ccd sco. this is illustrated in figure 4 which compares tco from omi mls versus o3sondes and o3 vmr from omi mls versus o3sondes. the mls instrument is a thermal-emission mls that measures vertical profiles of mesospheric stratospheric and upper tropospheric t o3 and other constituents from limb scans ahead of the aura satellite. the combo ctm is used in this study to simulate tropospheric o3 and compare with measurements from omi mls. two images of omi mls o3 mean vmr over an entire hemisphere centered over the north atlantic ocean. all omi l3 total o3 data in this study were further screened for cloudy scenes by rejecting o3 measurements where omi l3 reflectivity is greater than 0. that study along with similar analyses by others indicates that mls tends to overestimate o3 in the lower stratosphere by several percent. the mls o3 profile measurements were interpolated to the existing ncep tropopause pressure to derive sco. the authors also thank the aura mls and omi instrument and algorithm teams for the extensive satellite measurements used in this study. mls also measures o3 and other atmospheric constituents for descending nighttime orbits that on a given day can be up to ±12 hours different in time from omi measurements. sco is determined by integrating mls o3 from 0. in regional assessments both omi mls and model tco indicate lowest global values of tropospheric o3 yearround over the broad tropical pacific and also in the southern polar region in summer and autumn months. as a final topic we investigate the feasibility of obtaining daily maps of tropospheric o3 from omi mls. figure 8 shows two images of omi mls o3 vmr over an entire hemisphere centered over the north atlantic. all of these issues for improving the daily tropospheric o3 maps from omi and mls are being investigated as work in progress. measurements of mls sco were determined by a standard method of pressure integration of o3 volume mixing ratio : sco = 0. omi is a nadir-scanning instrument that at visible and uv wavelength channels detects backscattered solar radiance to measure column o3 with near global coverage over the earth with a resolution of 13 km 24 km at nadir. it was shown that the maps of omi mls tropospheric o3 have useful potential in tracking pollution events either regionally or globally even though current daily measurements have known difficulties caused by both instrument retrievals and the residual technique used. in both observed tco from ep toms uars mls and the mozart-2 model. a main advantage of the new aura mls and omi combination has been implemented to derive tco measurements is that near-global maps of calibrated tco and sco fields from the aura satellite where total column can be obtained on a daily basis which was not possible with o3 is measured by the dutch-finnish o3 monitoring previous satellite measurements. tco fields for september november for both model and omi mls are similar in the southern hemisphere with largest values around 40 45 du in the south atlantic and low o3 amounts 20 du over the tropical pacific and high southern latitudes. january and february show the lowest levels of globally averaged o3 in the troposphere for the year of omi mls data analyzed in this study. two conclusions from figure 4 are that neither omi mls tco nor mean vmr for the first year of aura measurements exhibit substantial offset differences relative to o3sondes and for validation purposes involving midlatitudes with sparse o3sonde data it may be better to compare o3 vmr rather than tco because of added noise generated from tropopause height fluctuations. 25 longitude sco maps similar to omi l3 total column o3. figure 3 shows time series comparisons for september 2004 to august 2005 of monthly averaged tropospheric o3 vmr from omi mls and o3sondes. comparisons between omi and dobson total o3 indicates that omi is around 0. 5 retrievals have difficulty in accurately measuring o3 beyond 215 hpa; it is anticipated that the next mls version will improve this condition. who combined several years of sage stratospheric o3 measurements with nimbus 7 toms total o3. aside from o3 omi can also determine cloud-top pressure aerosols and aerosol parameters no2 so2 and other trace constituents in the troposphere and stratosphere. we also appreciate the efforts of the shadoz science team for producing the shadoz o3sonde data and also bojan bojkov for providing mls data from the nasa aura validation data center. figure 2 shows color contour diagrams of omi mls tco and o3 mean vmr averaged for july 2005. omi mls tco and tropospheric o3 mean vmr for july 2005. show an early validation analysis of

to omi mls which is an average measurement over a generally broad geographical region. figure 8 suggests that the daily maps of omi mls tropospheric o3 may be useful for tracking pollution events; however the daily maps currently have difficulties. this study has also examined other methods including assimilation of mls o3. time series comparisons of monthly averaged tropospheric o3 vmr from omi mls and o3sondes for september 2004 to august 2005. omi and mls o3 retrievals indicate no substantial calibration differences for measuring tropospheric o3 as inferred from comparisons with both omi ccd measurements of sco and o3sondes extending from the tropics to high latitudes. omi total o3 measurements have been validated extensively by comparison with both ground-based brewer and dobson data and also earth probe toms and sbuv measurements from various national oceanic and atmospheric administration satellites. although the recommended range for mls o3 profile measurements is 0.

solar 27 day cycles. mls provides the first long-term continuous global daily vertical profile data for oh and ho2 for both day and night. overview of daytime global mean data of mls off-line ho2. while continuous observations of mls oh are not available after the end of 2009 the new ho2 data are a promising alternative for investigating hox variability. the recently developed ho2 data from the aura mls make it possible for the first time to investigate the subtle signals of solarinduced ho2 variability. we extended the analysis to all other pressure levels for which mls ho2 data are available. vertical profile of mls ho2 sensitivity to solar lyman α variability of ho2 variability with lyman α are also. recently an “off-line” version of the mls ho2 data product with significantly improved quality has been developed bringing a brand new opportunity. while the mls ho2 data record is over 10 years long and covers the current 11 year solar cycle peak the original standard mls ho2 data lack the accuracy and stability needed for studying the subtle solar cycle variability. ho2 data during the earlier years of aura mls when solar activity was moderate were also analyzed. aura mls ho2 data mls was launched in july 2004 on the sun-synchronous aura satellite. daily measurements of mls ho2 are continuing and currently provide the only available long-term global data set for ho2. signatures of solar 27 day cycle variability in mls ho2 data at six pressure levels in the mesosphere. 01 hpa cannot be confirmed with mls ho2 data', '1 the measurement and estimation procedure the

−15% without assimilation to 5% and increasing the correlation from 0. co fields calculated by linco assimilated mopitt co and mls co in parts per billion by volume in october 2004 and april 2005 at 146 hpa. the vertical resolution of mls co retrieved profiles is about 3-4 km in the stratosphere and the horizontal resolution is between 500 km for lower stratospheric levels and 300 km for upper stratospheric levels. 3 in this section we compare the linco simulation with mls co data in order to evaluate the co linear scheme in the lower stratosphere. which may also contribute to this high difference between mopitt co analyses and mls co at high latitudes. above the altitude pressure of 20 hpa an increase of co is observed by mls both for the south pole in october 2004 and for the north pole in march 2005. conversely over africa there is an underestimation of the co concentration compared to mls data likely inducing the stronger underestimation over south east asia due to horizontal and vertical transport deficiencies and also to too much co destruction and too low emissions over africa in the linear scheme. mopitt co analyses also present a good agreement with mls data at 146 hpa. for october 2004 the results calculated with linco are different from the corresponding mls co fields. it leads to smaller co concentrations than the ones actually found by mls in the lower stratosphere. zonal monthly mean of co from linco and mls in parts per billion by volume and corresponding relative differences for october 2004 and march 2005. the mls co measurements are made in the 240 ghz region. 1 the bias may come from the linco coefficients which relax to a co climatology that is higher than measured by mls at these stratospheric pressure levels. a positive bias is observed between mls co and linco for pressure levels between 45 and 10 hpa for both months. at 146 hpa the assimilated co distribution is also improved compared to mls observations by reducing the bias up to a factor of 2 in the tropics. for both months the vertical and latitudinal gradients of co in the utls for pressures larger than 70 hpa are well represented by the model compared to mls co with the same range of mixing ratios except over the poles where the linco mixing ratios are underestimated compared to the co observed by mls. the mls co data set was validated by livesey et al. note that

placed into a near-polar earth orbit at ∼705 km with an inclination of 98◦ and an ascending mode at 13:45 h. figure 7 presents the co monthly zonal means for the month of october 2004 and march 2005 calculated for linco and mls co. co fields from linco simulation are smoothed by a theoretical triangular averaging kernel with the full-width at half-maximum equal to the mls vertical resolution according to pumphrey et al', \"h2o profiles measured by mls for july 16 2007 and june 30 2007. each calculation uses the zonal average mls h2o profile at 13h lt for the same latitude region. comparison of oh vertical density profiles measured by shimmer and mls and calculated by the nrl-chem1d photochemical model. also shown in figure 2 is the result of an nrlchem1d photochemical model calculation using standard jpl06 reaction rates mls h2o t and pressure profiles for the same latitude range. recently only four instruments in earth orbit have been capable of providing high vertical resolution oh altitude profiles in the mesosphere: the imaging spectrometric observatory the middle atmospheric high resolution spectrograph investigation the optical spectrograph and infrared imager system and the mls on aura. the model result is initialized with mls h2o for the same day latitudes and local time. observations to compare shimmer oh results with another coincident measurement we use observations from the mls instrument on nasa's aura satellite. the zonally averaged mls h2o profile for july 16 used in the model calculation is shown in red in figure 3. in this study we first compare the shimmer oh measurements with mls data at the local time of the mls measurements. in addition to the good agreement between shimmer and mls results the retrieved oh density approaches zero above 85km which confirms that oh signal from below does not contaminate the higher altitudes. we have also compared shimmer and mls oh observations near 13lt with results from a one-dimensional photochemical model using standard jpl06 chemistry where the model is initialized with mls h2o. discussion and conclusions we have compared mesospheric oh density profiles of shimmer and mls for the same day the same latitudes and at the same local time. it is important to note that while the averaging kernels for shimmer oh and mls oh are 3 7 km wide between 65 90 km the averaging kernels for the mls h2o are between 11 16 km wide. for the model results we use zonally averaged mls h2o profiles for the same latitude region and time periods measured at about 13h lt\", \"although the aura mls measurement locations and times are nearly coincident with caliop the spatial resolution of the mls gas species data is much coarser than that of the caliop psc data. to analyze caliop psc observations from 2006-2011 in conjunction with the aura mls data and t analyses from the goddard earth observing system data assimilation system. 5 we have used aura mls gas phase hno3 and h2o measurements along with geos-5 t analyses to independently assess the caliop psc composition classification scheme which is based solely on the lidar optical measurements. the ability of mls to accurately retrieve the reduction in gas-phase hno3 due to uptake by pscs will depend on both the spatial extent and homogeneity of the psc. one possible option would be to produce a “cloud-free” mls hno3 dataset using the caliop psc observations to filter out aura mls measurements that may be impacted by uptake by psc particles. figure 3 shows 2-d histograms of mls hno3 uptake vs. 2 the aura mls detects thermal microwave emission from the earth's limb along the line-of-sight in the forward direction of the aura spacecraft flight track. in addition ancillary meteorological parameters from the aura mls derived meteorological products such as equivalent latitude are also mapped onto the psc grid. for these mixtures the caliop βperp signal is more sensitive to the presence of the nat particles than the mls gas-phase hno3 uptake observations. for discussion we focus on caliop and mls data from the 2009-2010 arctic winter which complemented focused measurements from an extensive field campaign under the european union reconcile and nat as a function of t and t −tice. if the roughly 4-km vertical by 400-km horizontal mls field of view is not completely cloud-filled the retrieved hno3 value will be biased due to the influence of the higher background hno3 in non-cloudy regions of the fov. since aura flies in formation with calipso in the atrain satellite constellation caliop and mls measurement tracks are closely aligned with spatial and temporal differences less than 10 km and 30 s after a repositioning of the aura satellite in april 2008 and about 200 km and 7-8 min prior to 2008. uncertainty in mls h2o and geos5 ts produces ∼ ±1 k spread in data points along the t − tice axis. 3 our basic approach is to combine caliop psc observations with nearly coincident aura mls gas species measurements and geos-5 t analyses to track the uptake of gas phase hno3 as a function of t. the aura mls gas species data and derived meteorological products were provided courtesy of the mls team and obtained through the aura mls website. however given the relatively coarse resolution of both the geos-5 gridded analyses and aura mls hno3 measurements small scale wave features are more difficult to fully resolve. relationships with the coincident mls hno3 and h2o abundances. demonstrated that one can also gain valuable insight into psc processes by analyzing the caliop data in combination with nearly coincident gas phase hno3 and h2o measurements from the mls on the aura satellite. uncertainty in mls hno3 coupled with the fov bias accounts for no more than 1-2 ppbv of the spread in data points along the hno3 axis in fig. t is the ambient t at the caliop observation point and tice is the frost point t calculated using the coincident aura mls gasphase h2o abundance. mls hno3 values will be biased when the pscs only partially fill the instrument's fov. since hno3 and or h2o are the major constituents of all psc particles tracking their uptake by pscs as a function of t using mls data provides constraints on particle composition and volume density\", \"2 talis has similar bands to the aura mls. talis covers most spectral bands of the aura mls and extends them but lacks the 2. the mls demonstrated that so2 can be measured by 190 240 and 640 ghz radiometers but only the 240 ghz so2 product is recommended for general use. the broader bandwidth and the finer resolution of talis can provide a better retrieval precision and effective altitude range compared with the aura mls. the mls measured ch3oh and ch3cn in the troposphere and lower stratosphere by the 625 ghz spectrometer. o3 product comparison between the talis fft spectrometer and mls “standard”' spectrometer using the 235. spectral bands of the aura mls and talis radiometers. 4 promising products the unique products are the target species which are not covered by the aura mls but which are covered by talis. the mls standard so2 product is taken from the 240 ghz retrieval but is only effective when its concentration is significantly enhanced. the major spectral line of co used by the mls is at 230. the 240 ghz radiometer can be used to measure so2 in the same way as mls. h2o product comparison between the talis fft spectrometer and mls “standard” spectrometer using the 183. t product comparison between the talis fft spectrometer and the mls “standard” spectrometer using the 118. no2 is a unique species not covered by the aura mls and talis' wider bandwidth and finer resolution have the potential ability to measure it. 5 k better than the aura mls at about 15-30 km and the vertical resolution is also improved. according to the simulation results talis can do a better job than the aura mls because of the wider bandwidth and finer resolution. a simulation is performed to compare the performance of the main products between the talis fft spectrometer and the aura mls “standard” 25-channel spectrometer. the only so2 which is observable by the mls comes from volcanic eruptions\", \"also note that the bias patterns are quite symmetric between the two hemispheres despite different o3 fields which suggests that these biases are likely caused by sza-dependent errors such as errors due to omi straylight errors and radiative transfer calculation errors. both omi mls shows large spatial variability of o3 at the mid-latitudes likely associated with synopticscale disturbances that affect o3 in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. we also validate stratospheric o3 column down to 215 hpa with mls data. 2 the lower boundary of 215 hpa recommended for using mls o3 may be below or above the tropopause depending on the location. the excellent omi mls agreement suggests that mls data with higher vertical resolution and omi data with high horizontal resolution and global coverage can be combined to study the spatiotemporal distribution of stratospheric o3. figure 4 shows the mean biases and standard deviations of the differences between omi and mls o3 profiles as functions of latitude. in addition to comparison with original mls profiles we also compare omi with convolved mls o3 profiles using eq. the intercomparison with mls data improves the characterization of mls o3 by reducing mls's uncertainty estimates. aura makes comprehensive measurements of stratospheric and tropospheric composition from four instruments including omi and mls. scatter density plot of omi and coincident mls stratospheric o3 column above 215 hpa during 2006. this results partly from the close omi mls collocation and partly from the high precision of omi stratospheric o3. 4 we validate o3 profiles retrieved from omi ultraviolet radiances using one year of collocated aura mls data for 2006. notably at high latitudes omi shows some positive biases over altitudes of maximum o3 density and some negative biases below 100 hpa. the smaller standard deviations for a priori profiles likely indicate that combined errors from omi and mls exceed the natural variability of o3. profiles of partial o3 column densities in 24 layers from the surface to ∼60 km are retrieved from omi radiances in the spectral region 270-330 nm using the optimal estimation technique. mls o3 profiles in volume mixing ratio are integrated to partial o3 columns for each layer using a code provided by the mls team. omi retrievals generally track mls o3 very well with much better correspondence compared to the a priori values although large differences can occur. comparison of omi stratospheric o3 column above 215 hpa along the mls track and mls retrievals for the same orbit as in fig. to convolve mls o3 profiles with omi aks mls partial o3 columns above 215 hpa are complemented with omi retrievals below 215 hpa and interpolated to the corresponding omi retrieval grid. omi radiances are pre-calibrated based on two days' average radiance differences in the tropics between omi observations and simulations with zonal mean mls data for pressure <215 hpa and climatological o3 profiles for pressure >215 hpa. smoothing errors from omi are estimated statistically in our retrievals but can also be estimated directly using coincident mls data by assuming the mls data to be the truth and simulating the expected retrieved from our omi algorithm with the use of omi averaging kernels to degrade mls profiles to the omi vertical resolution : x0mls = xa + a where xa is the a priori o3 profile used in omi retrievals and a is the ak matrix. the mls o3 used to validate omi retrievals is the version 2. mls stratospheric o3 column down to 215 hpa on 11 june 2006. mls soc is integrated from original mls o3 profiles between 0. because oc can be derived more accurately from our retrieval algorithm than current omi operational total o3 algorithms this validation of omi soc implies that toc can be accurately estimated from omi data alone at high spatial resolution and with global coverage without the need to use limb instruments to measure soc and interpolation techniques to increase the spatial coverage of soc. this omi mls intercomparison demonstrates that omi retrievals despite having coarser vertical resolution can be used to validate mls and other stratospheric o3 measurements made even with higher vertical resolution than omi. figure 1 compares omi and mls partial o3 columns at six selected layers for one orbit of retrievals on 11 july 2006. this omi mls intercomparison suggests that omi retrievals can be used to augment the validation of mls and other stratospheric o3 measurements. this negative bias is not entirely from omi because mls o3 has been found to have some positive biases in this altitude range relative to other correlative measurements. omi retrievals are then interpolated to partial o3 columns at the mls layers. clouds are not filtered because we are comparing stratospheric o3 and filtering omi cloudy pixels only improves slightly the overall comparison. the dutch-finnish omi instrument is part of the nasa eos aura satellite payload. mls measures vertical profiles of mesospheric stratospheric and upper tropospheric t o3 co h2o and many other constituents. the retrievals are constrained with monthand latitude-dependent climatological a priori o3 profiles and corresponding variances derived from 15 years of o3sonde and sage data under consideration of omi random-noise measurement errors\", 'moreover the n2o concentration of the nudged ccm was higher than that of mls inside and outside the polar vortex as shown in figures 4c and 4d. the smiles observation mls observation and nudged ccm calculation revealed a highly longitudinal dependent structure of distributions of o3 and associated chemical constituents in addition to o3 tendency at high latitudes during the ssw. those of clo are also similar between smiles and mls considering the difference in the local time for the measurement. livesey eos mls observations of o3 loss in the 2004-2005 arctic winter geophys. in addition n2o data of mls were used to diagnose the transport of nudged ccm. figure 6b shows the longitude-altitude sections of o3 hcl clo and n2o concentrations of mls and nudged

mixing ratio clo volume mixing ratio and n2o volume mixing ratio at 50 hpa on 8 12 16 20 23 27 and 30 january 2010 observed by aura mls. the n2o concentration in the lower stratosphere of the nudged ccm was overestimated in comparison with the n2o concentration observed by mls. the evolution and distribution of o3 and hcl inside outside the polar vortex are quite similar between smiles and mls in january 2010. the nudged ccm n2o concentrations inside of the polar vortex were slightly higher than those of mls in the lower and middle stratosphere. although the precisions of o3 hcl and clo data of mls were lower than those of smiles the longitude-altitude sections of these chemical constituent 6. because the clo concentration inside the polar vortex of the nudged ccm was somewhat lower than that of smiles and mls observations it is considered that the chemical o3 tendency inside the vortex estimated by the model outputs has been underestimated. the contrast between the inside and outside areas of the polar vortex was also evident in n2o distribution observed by mls in figure 6b. 2 k for aura mls. this study has shown the distributions of o3 and associated chemical constituents observed by smiles and mls as well as simulation results obtained from a nudged ccm before and during the major ssw in january 2010 at which time the zonal mean zonal wind and t changed rapidly. by using smiles and mls data in addition to using a nudged chemistry-climate model we quantitatively demonstrate the difference in o3 tendency inside and outside the polar vortex during the 2009 2010 ssw when the o3 distribution was highly dependent on longitude owing to the polar vortex shift. the concentrations of clo of the nudged ccm at 50 hpa were somewhat lower than those of smiles and mls and the difference in the clo concentrations is significant in the latter half of january. although the clo data of mls on 8 january and 12 january indicate slightly higher values than those of smiles on these days the difference may result from the difference in the local time for measurement because the nudged ccm outputs interpolated to their measurement times also indicate similar differences. for example vortex-averaged clo concentration of the model was lower than those of smiles and mls by 30% around 23 january. zurek arctic o3 depletion observed by uars mls during the 1994-95 winter geophys. because smiles did not make measurements north of 65°n we also used o3 hcl and clo data measured by the earth observing system aura mls data. diurnal o3 variations in the stratosphere

january 2010 observed by mls and calculated by ccm nudged toward u v and t of era-interim data. because clo concentration inside the polar vortex in the model was somewhat lower than those of smiles and mls observation as shown in figures 4 and 6 and because catalytic o3 destruction cycles associated with clo are important inside the polar vortex it is considered that the o3 chemical tendency inside the vortex estimated by the model outputs has been underestimated. the nudged ccm was able to simulate these values although the o3 concentration of the nudged ccm is slightly overestimated mostly outside the polar vortex compared with those of smiles and mls observations. figures 4a and 4c indicate that the evolution and distribution of o3 and hcl inside outside the polar vortex are quite similar between smiles and mls. validation of the aura mls clo measurements j', 'these results are particularly noteworthy because the true magnitude and number of h2o enhancements over the us in summer is likely significantly greater than reported by the mls satellite instrument. stratospheric h2o values over the us in summer significantly higher than 10 ppmv have been observed by the mls satellite instrument as well as in situ aircraft instruments. the vertical coordinate system most appropriate for the quantitative coupling of the nexrad observations to that of inorganic chlorine is potential t because in the absence of diabatic processes air parcels in the stratosphere are transported along surfaces of constant potential t such that long-lived trace species exhibit consistent correlations with one another. 62 a key contribution that the nexrad system provides is the ability to map the stormtop potential t as a function of geographic position frequency and month of occurrence. given the development of sophisticated data analyses employing the nexrad weather radar network and the availability of high spatial resolution high accuracy in situ t data what has now emerged is a new understanding of the remarkable coincidence between the conditions present in the lower stratosphere over the us in summer and the trigger point for dramatically enhanced catalytic loss rates of o3 resulting from the t-h2o kinetics of heterogeneous catalytic conversion of inorganic chlorine to free radical form on simple sulfate-water aerosols followed by the homogeneous catalytic removal of o3 by the two halogen catalytic cycles engaging the cloocl dimer46 and the coupled clo bro catalytic cycle. another key piece of evidence relating the observations of enhanced h2o to their convective source comes from the ace-fts satellite observations of the concentration of the heavy water isotopologue hdo globally in the lower stratosphere67 as well as in situ observations of hdo within regions of convective injection from nasa aircraft missions. the reason is that elevated h2o from convective injection is localized in space and typically layered vertically such that the spatial resolution of mls may often exceed the dimensions of the perturbation or randomly transect it leading to an underestimate of the mixing ratio. for example a 2 km deep layer of elevated water of 50 km horizontal extent even with optimal alignment of the convected geometry along the north-south viewing track of mls will only fill 1 6 of the mls sample volume with the other 5 6 filled with background levels of h2o. the depth and frequency of penetration has significant consequences so we delineate here the quantitative specifics of the nexrad observations with high spatial

satellite. in this work we will focus on the o3 and oh eos mls version 1. because of the running average procedure performed on the mls data set it is not trivial to estimate the delay between the oh rise and o3 depletion. a decrease in the stratospheric o3 is present in the mls january 2005 data but it seems to start before the 17 january sep event although an increment in the depletion appears after the 20 january gle. the mls instrument measures the oh mixing ratio during day and night conditions by thermal emission over the range 18-94 km. moreover the mls o3 data version 1', \"this can be attributed to the use of the fk98 o3 climatology to specify the reference state mixing ratio values ro. this is due to the fact that the fk98 stratospheric o3 climatology is based largely on sbuv instrument data which have reduced vertical resolution compared to the more recent o3 profile measurements used to compile the urap o3 climatology. the linearization approach to photochemical production and loss of stratospheric o3 goes back to the pioneering work of lindzen and goody who derived analytical expressions for the linearized photochemical production and loss coefficients based on pure oxygen photochemistry. figures 14 and 15 show that when the ad-hoc adjustments to the gsfc production rates are included the 135-h and 138-h gsfc2 hindcast o3 profiles show much better agreement with mls observations. at the lower latitudes there is good agreement between the 135-h hindcast nogaps-alpha ts and aura mls ts below the 0. 1 o3 photochemistry schemes and aura mls t profiles at each location for this date and time. next we compare the active o3 fields output from the five nogaps-alpha hindcast experiments with aura mls o3 profile measurements along the flight

mls o3 profile measurements along the 16:00 ut mls flight track indicated in fig. similar results are also seen when we compare the 138-h nogaps-alpha o3 hindcasts with the 18:00 ut mls profiles. we can examine the contribution to the steady-state mixing ratio from each of the three terms in by defining the following relations: r = ro + oτo3 rss t = ro +. at 50◦ n and 20 hpa where nogapsalpha prognostic o3 values are higher than mls observations nogaps-alpha ts are 10-20 k colder than to. 0 results exhibit an unusual vertical structure above the 10 hpa level which is most pronounced at the lower latitudes and leads to overestimates of the o3 mixing ratio at numerous points relative to the mls profiles. 2 the fk98 climatology tends to underestimate the peak o3 value as compared to various uars o3 measurements. it follows that in the presence of a non-zero difference between the model o3 mixing ratio r and the assumed reference o3 mixing ratio ro in the upper stratosphere the second term on the right hand side of will quickly “relax” r towards the climatological value ro. in the present study the chem2d-opp formulation employs the same 2-d o3 mixing ratio climatology described in the previous section to specify both ro and 6o. the fact that nogaps-alpha prognostic o3 profiles with a t sensitivity term show the poorest agreement with mls o3 in the 2-20 hpa region at the higher latitudes suggests that the problem could be related to deficiencies in the nogaps-alpha simulation of ts fig. it is worth noting that the gmao analysis is based primarily on sbuv o3 measurements as is the 2d stratospheric o3 climatology of fortuin and kelder used for ro in chem2d-opp. thus the high o3 values in the 16:00 ut nogaps-alpha hindcasts for at 50◦ n relative to mls

and grossly underestimate the o3 mixing ratios as compared to the mls measurements. 12 shows that all three modeled o3 profiles agree quite well with each other and with the mls data below the 10 hpa level from 10◦ n-40◦ n. this would improve nogaps-alpha mesospheric shortwave heating rate calculations and correct our model's high t bias compared to aura mls ts in this region. 1 chem2d-opp in nogaps-alpha: hindcast mode this section presents a case study comparing nogapsalpha o3 hindcasts using chem2d-opp with aura mls measurements of stratospheric o3 and available in-situ profile measurements taken aboard the nasa dc8 flight of 7 february 2005 as part of the polar aura validation experiment. figure 12 plots the six individual aura mls profiles indicated on the 16:00 ut path in fig. 18 it is reasonable to conclude that most of the differences between the chem2d-opp gsfc2 and cd86 hindcast o3 profiles relative to the mls observations in figs. the fact that the 135-h t79l60 nogaps-alpha o3 hindcasts at 50◦ n overestimate the o3 mixing ratios between 30-10 hpa as compared to the 16:00 ut mls observations regardless of the photochemistry parameterization suggests that the model dynamics may not be accurately simulating some small-scale structure in the o3 profile at this location. at 50◦ n and 60◦ n the o3 hindcasts tend to overestimate mixing ratios from 10-30 hpa

shows that the negative o3 trend in the tropics near 10 hpa continued from august 2004 to june 2013. nevertheless the qualitative agreement between the model and the ace and mls measurements supports the idea that the observed o3 change can be caused by a dynamical perturbation. we thus conclude that over the period of the mls measurements the effect of changes in transport on n2o in this region on noy and hence o3 dominate any increase in n2o due to changing tropospheric emissions. 2 we show the linear trend in the global haloe o3 measurements from 1991 to 2005. show that the mls trends in

o3 mixing ratio. the calculated linear trend in haloe o3 for 19912005. from mls and ace measurements we conclude that the noy variations are the result of a decrease in n2o from 1992 to 2012 resulting from changes in the dynamics over this period. figure 5 presents monthly median mls n2o and o3 data from 5 s5 n at 10 hpa. measurements are figure 8 shows that no c no2 generally was increasing over the course of the haloe measurements and that this increase tracked the o3 decrease both on a year-toyear timescale and over the full 1992-2005 time period. 8 we show annual median haloe anomalies in o3 alongside those of no c no2. 8 we separate the haloe sunrise and sunset measurements and calculate trends for four separate measurements: sunrise and sunset o3 and sunrise and sunset no c no2. with the exception of this feature the general consistency between the qbo driven variations in o3 and no c no2 and the trend which is apparent in both the o3 and no c no2 measurements provides added confidence that the decrease in o3 and the increase in no c no2 measured by haloe from 1992 to 2005 are both correct and further are coupled. the trends in the haloe o3 measurements have been compared against sage ii and differences have been found to be on the order of less than 0. monthly median n2o and o3 mixing ratios at 10 hpa from mls measurements between 5 s and 5 n. 1 we show the annual

here we also get a somewhat reduced o3 response compared with the observations. 3 we show the linear trend in o3 as measured by mls. while haloe did not provide measurements of n2o and did not provide the full complement of noy species that is available from ace it did provide measurements of two of the key odd-nitrogen species no and no2. while ace does not provide the daily measurement coverage in the tropics obtained by mls it does measure all of the species relevant to the nitrogen chemistry which determines o3 near 10 hpa in the tropics. haloe measurements ceased in 2005 and aura mls has

a quite similar figure for linear trends in haloe o3 but in % decade 1. mls measurements of o3 and n2o are available since 2004. what we conclude here is that because of changes in transport the n2o which arrived in this region experienced significantly more dissociation in 2013 than in 2004 and based on inferences from the haloe o3 and nox measurements that this trend was also present throughout much of the haloe measurement period. correlation coefficients between n2o and o3 calculated from monthly median anomalies from mls data as a function of latitude and pressure. there is some overlap

60 km and increasing with altitude to approximately 1 ppm at 80 km altitude. during the period of strong co variation in december 2009 kimra was not operational but this variation is consistent for mls and sdwaccm', 'the mls minimum in tropical h2o at 23 km is about 1-2 km higher than any of the model cases. the asc and mls zonal mean djf 2008 2009 h2o fields are shown in figures 9a and 9b.

hemisphere dobson and brewer stations. while the vertical resolution of an omps np o3 retrieval is somewhat coarse in comparison with the lp sensor about 8 km resolution in the stratosphere np provides valuable data for the continuation of the historical sbuv 2 o3 data record and for validation of the omps lp retrievals. because the omps instrument suite includes both a total o3 mapper and a limb profiler a similar technique can be applied as with omi mls. mod o3 for this time period is based on combining o3 from sbuv 2 instruments on three satellites: noaa 16 18 and 19. the omi mls tropospheric o3 time series currently spans over 12 years and has been a central data product for each of the bams state of the climate reports since 2013 and will be used in the upcoming international tropospheric o3 assessment report. total column o3 from the omps nadir mapper agrees with mod o3 and with noaa 19 sbuv 2 o3 with a bias of 0:2 % and a small time-dependent drift of 0. for comparison the blue solid curve shows the same tropospheric o3 derived by subtracting stratospheric o3 from the omps lp from total column o3 from the nm. in each case the red dashed curve shows tropospheric o3 derived by subtracting mls stratospheric o3 from omi total column o3. 3 shows that omps nm has very little drift in o3 relative to the ground observations and an average bias of less than 0. the omps o3 measurements can also be used to calculate tropospheric o3 and continue the current omi mls time series of measurements should either of the aura instruments fail. the right panel

the stratospheric o3 mixing ratio is plotted for omps np version 2 for noaa 19 sbuv 2 for the aura mls and for the omps limb profiler. 9 shows that there is a significant underestimate of o3 relative to noaa 19 mls and lp in the 6 to 10 hpa region. this technique has most recently been applied by subtracting stratospheric o3 measured by the aura mls instrument from total column o3 measured by the aura omi instrument. figure 8 shows the timedependent difference of np from the noaa 19 sbuv 2 retrievals averaged over low to middle latitudes for the upper stratosphere lower stratosphere and total

between 10 and 50 hpa are shown because the sbuv nadir o3 retrieval algorithm produces little profile information on the distribution of o3 below 20 km. but it should be noted that the column amount of o3 in the troposphere is retrieved accurately as evidenced by the fact that total column o3 from an sbuv retrieval is accurate to 1 % or better (mcpeters et al. this time series is a unified multi-instrument o3 data set created by merging data from a series of sbuv and sbuv 2 instruments beginning with the original buv instrument launched on nimbus 4 in 1970 and extending to the sbuv 2

there exist observations of volcanic so2 by the microwave limb-emission sounder mls on aura. the determination of masses of emitted so2 was complicated due to an underestimation of the total mass directly after the eruptions which has become evident by a comparison with so2 masses derived from mls. 13 we show an example of the development of the total mass of so2 as calculated from mls and mipas volume mixing ratios during a period of time around the eruption of sarychev on 12 june 2009. when comparing mipas and mipasmon profiles of so2 separately for mipas periods p1 and p2 and additionally excluding volcanically enhanced periods we reach the same conclusion as from the comparison with ace-fts in fig. comparison of the mipas so2 measurements with those of the ace-fts instrument revealed an altitude-dependent offset in the background so2 concentrations of the second major measurement period of mipas. who discuss aura mls limb measurements. 1 comparison with ace-fts we have performed a comparison of mipas altitude profiles of so2 with those of the ace-fts instrument. this is attributed to sampling artifacts caused by the discard of mipas spectra with large aerosol contribution an effect similar to the “aerosol cloud top” feature in sage ii observations and the smearing of so2 profile maxima in case of extremely high mixing ratios where the spectral lines are saturated and thus carry less information. in the case of enhanced so2 vmr values differences between mipas and ace-fts are generally in the range of 30 pptv reaching values of 50-100 pptv only at a few altitudes. such an underestimation of so2 in mipasmon for volcanically enhanced periods has already been suspected when comparing the so2 distribution of july 2009 between ace-fts and mipasmon retrievals. 6 observations the comparison of mipas so2 with ace-fts and mipasmon is only possible for altitudes above 12. ace-fts is one of the instruments belonging to the scisat-1/ace space mission launched in august 2003', \"as the ace-fts anomalies show no large changes in trend after haloe's termination there is good reason to believe that this assumption is valid. a similar principle applies to mls which observes clo in the ascending node from 12:45-14:45 h and descending node from 00:45-02:45 h for this latitude range. for the record we do not see such problems using mls for either day or night time measurements since the aura satellite has orbit stabilization. the mls am measurements are made typically when the lst is between 01:00 h and 03:00 h a time when clo concentrations are close to zero ppbv below 40 km. 6 we have analysed the long-term evolution of stratospheric hcl using combined haloe and ace-fts hcl measurements from 1993-2008. 1 hcl as the main focus of the hcl analysis is on the upper stratosphere we firstly filter both haloe and ace-fts data between 35 and 45 km into three latitude bands: 30◦ s-50◦ s 20◦ s-20◦ n and 30◦ n-50◦ n. 2 ace-fts another infrared solar occultation instrument yielding vertical profiles of hcl concentrations is the ace fourier transform spectrometer. haloe hcl validation paper. however we do not find any significant differences in the overall trend magnitudes using simulated diurnal cycles from the winter and summer solstice cases therefore the choice of using a clo diurnal cycle for equinox is justified. however this is of little relevance here as we examine mls clo measurements between 6. mls clo data are screened using only profiles that have a zero status flag so that profiles with possible ambiguities are removed. differences between mls and smr are typically no larger than ∼0. as the species measured by haloe give relatively good information regarding o3 and cly chemistry it means that the procedure forces the model to be constrained by the haloe observations during each new run's initialisation. scaled smr and mls clo observations as a function of time for 35-45 km and 20◦ s-20◦ n. however due to the sparse ace-fts hcl data around the tropics we only remove the seasonal cycle in the tropics bin. here a piece-wise linear trend is defined over the total time series period t such that there is a change in trend magnitude at a given time t = t0 and is described here as t = b + a1x1t + a2x2t + nt where 1haloehcl are the haloe hcl anomalies to be modeled with seasonal and qbo parameters removed. moreover mls and ace-fts hcl data agree better than either versus haloe. as clo has a strong diurnal variation it is important to consider the local solar time of the measurements of both smr and mls. clo anomalies for smr and mls for 20◦ s20◦ n and 35-45 km. in order to model the hcl anomalies from haloe and ace-fts time series we apply a linear regression model to each set of anomalies independently accounting for fluctuations related to the qbo fig. aura-mls and ace-fts trend values show a decline in hcl to be −6 % ± 1 % decade−1 and −9 % ± 2 % decade−1 respectively since 2004. the model is initialised by zonally averaged vertical profiles of o3 h2o ch4 hcl no and no2 measured by haloe at times during either sunrise or sunset. also investigated haloe hcl between 35 and 39 km for 10◦ n-30◦ n where they applied a fit to the haloe data from 1997-2005 producing a hcl linear trend of −5 % ± 1. 3 mls stratospheric clo is studied using measurements of the mls which was launched in july 2004 on the nasa aura satellite. this is the second mls instrument whereas the previous instrument on board the uars platform operated for ∼8 years between 1991 and 1999 but is not included in this analysis. they found a significant linear decline of clo of −15 % ± 2 % decade from 1995-2005 for altitudes between 35 and 39 km although they estimate that about 30 % of this decline can be attributed to ch4 increments in this altitude range which have been measured by haloe. however there is a large degree of variability in the values between 1997 and 2002 which is also seen in previous findings for haloe hcl observations at 55 km although these features are not fully understood. haloe employed a solar occultation instrument measuring many trace gases including hcl. in order to test how the haloe hcl behaves in the tropics we have examined haloe residuals in 5◦ latitude bands spanning 30◦ s-30◦ n. comparisons of ace-fts hcl to various other satellite and ground based instrumentation show that there is a good agreement of generally better than 5-10 % above 20 km. 2 clo a summary of the scaled smr and mls measurements is presented in fig. haloe the haloe instrument aboard the uars was operational from september 1991 to november 2005. who examined hcl for the same altitude region using haloe data from 1993-2003. however the computed scale factors for mls night profiles are overestimated due to the very low night time clo abundances below 40 km. hence the resulting haloe and ace-fts time series will be a monthly mean hcl time series with the seasonal components removed but still containing contributions from the qbo and other sources of variation. the reason for this is due to the sparse contribution of ace-fts hcl data between 20◦ s-20◦ n which causes difficulties in estimating reliable harmonics representing the cyclic behaviour of the qbo\", 'the mls instrument is on board the earth observing system aura spacecraft which was launched in 2004. aura mls data are available from http: disc. aura mls t and gph data from august 2004 to december 2016 were restricted to data obtained within a 10°

daily averaged mls t and gph observations were interpolated into 1 km bins between 85 and 95 km to produce t profiles using geometric heights obtained from gphs. we also performed a similar superposed epoch analysis on the mls mesospheric ts measured over the five meteor radars during the selected storms and found that the variations of mls mesospheric t during the storms are small and random. the mesospheric t from the mls does not seem to show a clear response to geomagnetic storms the reason for which is still unclear', 'time series of three-year average aura mls antarctic hno3 and h2o mixing ratio data in psc-free regions are shown in fig. since aura and calipso are both in the aqua satellite constellation with nearly identical orbits the mls and calipso ground tracks are close to

gas-phase hno3 and h2o. the aura mls gas species data were provided courtesy of the mls team and obtained through the aura mls website. the corresponding vortex-averaged differences between ambient t

measurements. they found that in the middle stratosphere the mls o3 data have small biases with a random error of the order of 5%. the major advantage in this combined assimilation is that the mls data give constrains to the computed o3 profiles in the stratosphere and in the upper troposphere whereas the sciamachy data brings information on the integrated o3 columns. zonal average of the difference in % between the time average o3 concentrations from the combined mls and latmosiasi analysis minus the ones from the combined mls and sciamachy analysis. for a period of five months which spans from august to december 2007 the metop-a iasi initial data set provided by the latmos inversion algorithm was compared to a four dimensional o3 field. a 15 days assimilation of mls data from this initial state was performed to obtain coherent o3 concentrations for 15 july 2007. the dotted line represents the free simulation the black line represents the combined mls and sciamachy o3 analysis. mls having no measurements beyond 82◦ s and beyond 82◦ n we assumed that the difference in this polar regions is constant and equal to the one computed on 82◦ s and on 82◦ n for respectively the southern and northern polar regions. this field results from the combined assimilation of o3 profiles from the mls limb instrument and of total o3 columns from the sciamachy nadir instrument. 3 the mls instrument has been flying onboard the aura satellite in a sun-synchronous polar orbit since august 2004. the standard deviation of the forecast error is about 15% of the o3 concentration for the mls assimilation and 2% for the sciamachy assimilation. since the assimilation of the mls data does not strongly constrain the tropospheric o3 concentrations the difference can arise from a tropospheric bias in the model as well as a bias in the mls or sciamachy data. during one aura orbit omi performs approximately 1650 measurements on the sunlit portion of the earth. 6 are not coherent with the difference between the total o3 column obtained with the mls and the sciamachy analyses. the first version of the mocage-palm assimilation system as it was originally implemented for the asset project provided good quality o3 fields compared with o3sondes and uars haloe measurements with errors of the same order as those produced by several other assimilation systems. for our study we have used the latest version of mls o3 product. the average represents the systematic error in terms of total column o3 between the latmos-iasi measurements and the combined mls and sciamachy analysis. we computed for the whole period the average and the standard deviation of the difference between the analysed sciamachy total o3 columns and the analysed mls ones. even if the mls data only provides o3 profiles the total o3 columns computed from the mls analysis account for the information brought by the instrument. in this region the analysis is mainly constrained by the good-quality mls data and the assimilation of total o3 columns has a small impact. 2 with o3 analysis the time average of all the computed departures between the latmos-iasi data and our combined mls and sciamachy

we use the omi total o3 columns produced with the knmi doas method. 4 the o3 analysis obtained by the combined assimilation of mls and sciamachy data as described previously must be compared to independent data. consequently for each month the differences between the sciamachy and the mls total o3 column analyses were averaged in time and longitude. similarly the assimilation of mls data produces an o3 overestimation at this altitude range especially over the spr. this algorithm is based on the total o3 doas algorithm developed for the omi instrument. average difference between the total o3 columns from the sciamachy analysis minus the total o3 columns from the mls analysis for the period 1 august to 31 december 2007. reported that compared to the o3sondes mls products overestimate o3 at 215 hpa by about 20% at middle and high latitudes. 3 the combined assimilation of mls and sciamachy data provides o3 concentrations in a good agreement with the independent o3sondes measurements mainly in the stratosphere. assuming that the assimilation of the mls data constrains mainly the stratosphere without bias the mls analysis would underestimates the total o3 in the equatorial region and overestimates it in the spr. 1 methodology the comparison between the reference latmos-iasi o3 data yiasi and the combined a mls and sciamachy analysis xm+s is performed at the latmos-iasi time and space resolution. as the difference between mls plus sciamachy analysis and o3sondes is very low in this altitude range it means that there is no real improvement or damage on the o3 bias in the stratosphere by assimilating latmos-iasi instead of sciamachy. therefore the total o3 columns computed from the mls analysis and those computed from sciamachy analysis can be legitimately compared. mean over the globe of the average and standard deviation of the difference in % between the latmos-iasi o3 data minus the co-located combined mls and sciamachy o3 analysis

december the total o3 columns from sciamachy analysis are lower than those from the mls analysis with little variations from one month to another\", 'it clearly shows that the downward flux is always more in c1 and c3 sectors whereas the in this study we have investigated the vertical and spatial variability of o3 and water vapour in the utls region during the passage of cyclones which occurred

comparison of mipas versus henpeissenberg and table mountain measurements of down aura mls and the theoretically predicted drifts of mipas to −8. 3 ppmv decade−1 for aura mls to approximately −0. only a few comparisons suggest that mipas o3 data do not reveal a drift such as the drift estimation versus ace-fts or even hint at positive drifts like the analysis comparing mipas with the lidar at

consideration. mainly focusing on tropospheric and stratospheric processes concerning o3 chemistry aura mls provides data on several atmospheric chemical species linked to o3 destruction including various reservoir gases. 2 of the aura mls data was used. we use the following procedure: mls o3 profiles are interpolated onto the mipas pressure grid for which corresponding altitudes are available. first a drift of the 475 order of magnitude such as the one established by comparison with aura mls can mostly be explained by drifts associated with the non-linearity correction for the mipas detector as already mentioned in sec. 3 ace-fts the fourier transform spectrometer of the scisat-1/ace is one of the two instruments aboard the canadian satellite scisat-1. 2 was originally performed on the mipas altitude grid we interpolated the aura mls data from its pressure grid to an adequate altitude grid using coincident ecmwf temperatures and pressure to calculate pressure-altitude relations. in addition to that the number of coinciding profiles with aura mls is the largest compared to all other instruments even when using strict coincidence criteria which presumably provides the most reliable analysis. the result is transformed back to the aura mls pressure grid. 0 aura mls v2. due to recent studies on mipas' nonlinearity correction and the analysis versus aura mls which presumably offers the most reliable drift estimates we assume that a drift in mipas o3 data is most likely of a magnitude of 0 to −0. table 2 summarizes these criteria for the different instruments and of the fit for the differences of aura mls and mipas. the latter transforms the finer sampled mipas profile to the coarser aura mls grid. with approximately 240 profiles per orbit aura mls provides a large number of profiles and is thus a very good candidate for drift estimation by means of coinciding profiles. 5 ppmv were deduced from aura mls and a multimodel mean at 100 hpa while at

ace-fts profiles to which no averaging kernels were applied. thus the drift estimate versus aura mls seems to be the most suitable candidate for shifting the mipas trends towards reality. using the transformations introduced above the mipas profile on the aura mls pressure grid can be written as vpxˆ mipas = vpamipasxtrue + vpεmipas. the large white area in the tropics where no dri2f0ts could be calculated results from ace-fts focusing on higher latitudes. 0 of the ace-fts o3 data was used for comparison. 330 aura mls and odin osiris do not cover the same time period. during the validation of the ace-fts o3 product. in addition to that the number of coinciding profiles with aura mls is the largest compared to all other instruments even when using strict coincidence criteria which presumably 480 provides the most reliable analysis. aura mls o3 profiles however have a finer altitude resolution than those of mipas and thus have to be smoothed using the mipas averaging kernels. 3 ppmv were found for the o3 ao amplitude in aura mls and a slightly smaller amplitude of ∼ 0. second there has been no indication of a possible drift in aura mls o3 data so far. significant areas

measurethe theoretically predicted drifts of mipas due to detector non-linearity suggest that it is most likely parison with recent research we ments nair et al. findings of the aforementioned authors' comparison of aura aura mls. we chose the drift estimates versus aura mls for correction of the mipas trends for two reasons. reement with o3 data of the mls on the uars and assess an amplitude maximum of ∼0. first a drift of the order of magnitude such as the one established by comparison with aura mls can mostly be explained by drifts associated with the nonlinearity correction for the mipas detector as already mentioned in sect. in order to avoid the related artefact the drift analysis has in addition also been performed on the aura mls pressure grid as explained in sect. we have performed mipas drift estimations versus aura mls ace-fts and odin osiris. solving this equation for vpεcombined gives vpεcombined = vpxˆ mipas − vpamipaswpxˆ mls where vpεcombined is the difference profile of the mipas and the aura mls o3 profile represented on the aura mls pressure grid\", 'this band gives much better accuracy in the troposphere than the uars mls instrument. 2% higher than omi total column o3. since aura is in a sun synchronous orbit with a 1:30 local equator crossing time the aura mls has nearly complete latitude coverage daily and its measurements are always near noon or near midnight. 0 retrieval of o3 profiles from nasa sbuv and noaa sbuv 2 instruments. mesospheric o3 the sbuv instruments infer an o3 profile by measuring backscattered sunlight in the ultraviolet. the sbuv profile retrieval algorithm derives a very accurate measure of the total amount of o3 between the ground and about 25 km but has little information on how it is distributed. the mls instrument on aura relies mostly on the 240 ghz band for its o3 retrievals. the aura mls data were obtained from the mls team via the aura validation data center while balloon sonde data were obtained from the woudc in canada and from the shadoz team at gsfc. comparisons the revised climatology should be more accurate than the previous climatology because of the use of aura mls data which have nearly full global coverage on a daily basis and because of the addition of more sonde data. there is a general small increase in o3 in the 35 to 48 km region that represents an mls versus sage difference. climatology by using o3 profile data from the aura mls instrument taking advantage of the excellent latitude coverage of mls and its improved accuracy at low altitudes over the uars mls instrument. based on comparisons with mls they argue that this asymmetry is mostly in tropospheric o3. data from the mls instrument on the aura spacecraft come close to meeting all these criteria. consequently in the mesosphere where there is a significant diurnal variation of o3 the mls daytime o3 is more appropriate for forming the climatology for use in buv retrievals than the night observations or an average of the two. total column o3 from the climatology compared with that from the omi instrument on aura. the 2007 climatology was considerably more detailed than the simple climatology that had been used for previous versions of the sbuv and toms retrievals which consisted of only 26 profiles with o3 in umkehr layers covering low mid and high latitude zones. diurnal variation of o3 since a sunrise sunset sage ii occultation measurement is being compared with a nearnoon mls observation and o3 in the mesosphere is higher at night than in the day. a low vertical resolution version of this same climatology with total o3 dependence added was used for total column o3 retrievals from toms and omi. the aura mls o3 data used in the climatology give excellent coverage even at high latitudes and because it can be used down to the 200 hpa level the effect of the limited number of sonde stations in many latitude zones is reduced for the middle troposphere part of the climatology. because the bdm cross sections are slightly smaller at the wavelengths used by our omi retrieval the resulting o3 is slightly higher. this represents a real difference between the mls and saber o3 retrievals. climatology but uses aura mls data rather than the sage ii data used previously. total column o3 from the climatology agrees with that from the omi usually to within 3% and on average agrees to about one percent. we thank the mls team and the many people who launch o3 sondes around the world. as shown in figure 5 the difference between the climatology and omi total column o3 exceeds 3% in only a few areas. to show that the new climatology accurately represents the atmosphere integrated total column o3 from the climatology each month is compared with zonal average o3 measured by the omi instrument on aura for the period 2005 through 2008. data from the aura mls instrument can reliably be used down to the 215 hpa level leading to much better coverage in the upper troposphere lower stratosphere region. o3 in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere measured by sage ii saber and sbuv in march in the 40 -50 n zone compared with the march climatology. the actual effect on the retrieved sbuv o3 profiles is small except in regions like the lower troposphere which mostly depend on the a priori and should not be considered a real retrieval. the decrease in o3 at high southern latitudes near 20 km comes mostly from better sampling of the o3 hole region by mls in september and october', 'the model underestimated the monthly mean o3 concentrations by 4-28 ppbv in the tropics and overestimated by up to about 20 ppbv in the southern midlatitudes relative to the airs omi retrievals at 510 hpa. we also tested the assimilation of airs omi multispectral retrievals of tropospheric o3 profiles. in airs omi da the spread was mainly increased by the covariance inflation process in o3 data assimilation. to measure the impact of assimilating tropospheric o3 profiles we conducted sensitivity data assimilation calculations using the airs omi multispectral tropospheric o3 profile retrievals. assimilation of stratospheric mls o3 measurements provides additional important corrections to the middle and upper tropospheric o3 with up to 10 ppbv positive increments over south korea and other areas in east asia. the airs omi o3 profile product containing both global survey and regional mapping mode data are publicly available via the aura validation data center website. we used mls data for pressures of less than 215 hpa for

phases in airs omi da than in the standard data assimilation calculation without any o3 assimilation. because of the lack of information on observation error in the retrieval data set the omi so2 error was set to be a constant value of 0. as shown by figure 13 assimilation of airs omi data alone reduced the mean model bias with respect to the mean dc-8 o3 profiles in the middle troposphere by approximately 90% in phases 1 and 2 and by approximately 70% in phase 4. the omi so2 data used were the planetary boundary layer vertical column so2 l2 product produced with the principal component

use in data assimilation. only clear-sky omi so2 data with solar zenith angles less than 70° were used while the first 10 and last 10 cross-track positions were excluded to limit the across-track pixels following fioletov et al. however since the a posteriori emission led to underestimations in the boundary layer so2 concentrations with respect to the dc-8 measurements the estimated emission in south korea could be underestimated associated with the large uncertainty and the assumed constant retrieval errors and air mass factor because of lack of information in the assimilated omi so2 retrievals. spatial distribution of mean analysis spread and mean o3 concentration from the reanalysis at 650 hpa averaged during individual phases for the airs omi data assimilation', 'cross sections of mls gph co and h2o composites in the extreme positive and negative phases are shown in figure 4 for both hemispheres. we extract the eof modes for gph co and h2o at each mls retrieval pressure to study mesosphere‐stratosphere coupling and descent in the polar 2 of 18 1. a wintertime mean of the mls data is removed for each grid cell before calculating the eof modes of gph h2o and co anomalies. method to characterize wintertime polar variability we apply an eof analysis as described by baldwin and dunkerton and compute the eof modes from daily gridded mls gph and tracers observations. mls high‐latitude zonal mean h2o and co volume mixing ratios in log of ppmv for 2005-2010 boreal winters. we have analyzed the leading eof modes of the aura mls gph h2o and co measurements in 2005-2010 and used the co and h2o annular mode indices to characterize polar dynamics and transport in the wintertime middle atmosphere. dynamics in the middle atmosphere determine westerly winds that forms from the balance between the the extent and timing of polar processes o3 chemistry coriolis force and radiative forcing. mls co volume mixing ratio shows a large vertical gradient with values from ppmv in the mesosphere to ppbv in the low stratosphere. details of the eof calculation from the mls gph and its comparison with that obtained from the longer‐term analysis are discussed by lee et al. aura mls data can provide new insights on the polar vortex dynamics throughout the middle atmosphere by extending the gph t and trace gas measurements from the upper troposphere to the mesopause. cross sections of the mls gph h2o and co composites across 90°w-90°e in both hemispheres for high and low indices of the first eof mode for gph co at 0. the mls gph low bias with respect to saber which increases with height is estimated to be 100 m or less for 10-0. mls gph accuracy and precision are ∼100 m in the middle stratosphere and ∼150 m at 316 hpa. the aura mls observation period covers six nh winter seasons during which three unusually strong and prolonged major ssws occurred. the mls observation shows ∼20 k increase of polar t during mid‐september 2007. accurate amount of mesospheric co and h2o from the mls observation will be useful to imposing realistic upper boundary conditions in the stratospheric atmosphere models. in the nh the vertical profiles of nam hnam and cnam indices from mls gph h2o and co exhibit significant interannual variability. below 50 hpa these modes represent less than 17% of the total variance likely due to the diminishing mls sensitivity to co and very low co mixing ratios. to better understand dynamical variability of the wintertime polar middle atmosphere we analyze aura mls gph co and h2o measurements to examine middle atmosphere dynamics and transport from the mesopause to the upper troposphere. in figure 11b the zonally averaged mls h2o vmr over high latitude of the sh shows that the mesospheric dry air is transported down to the upper stratosphere as a result of the descent inside the polar vortex. zonal mean mls co and h2o vmr in log ppmv as a function of latitude for the nh and for the sh winters. estimated the vertical descent inside the polar vortex from lagrangian transport calculations using uars mls and claes tracer observations. first three winter eof modes from mls gph co and h2o during boreal winters at 0. figure 8b shows the time‐height variation of mls h2o averaged over a high‐latitude bin. the nam from mls gph captures the dominant patterns of interannual variability in middle atmospheric dynamics. their results using the uars haloe ch4 are consistent with ours that the weaker planetary wave forcing in the sh winter results in more coherent descent of long‐lived tracers from the mesosphere than in the nh. as seen in figure 8a the zonally averaged mls co volume mixing ratio is between 1 and 35 ppmv in the pressure range 0. kawamoto and shiotani estimate the vertical descent using ch4 profiles from uars haloe in the stratosphere which yielded a value of 1. although we have also examined other mls trace gas measurements in this study we present the results for gph co and h2o. show the first six eof modes of the aura mls gph observations up to mesopause during extreme events such as stratospheric sudden warmings. the first eof modes from the gph co and h2o are significant at all mls pressure levels. details on validation of the mls gph field and t are discussed by schwartz et al. time‐height development of the first eof mode during boreal winters of 2005-2010 obtained from the eof analysis of the mls gph co and h2o. because aura mls sampling does not cover the regions poleward of 82° latitude the observations in latitude bins between 20°n and 82°n for nh during the winter months are used to derive the winter eof modes. in this study we apply the same algorithms as used for the nh to compute the first eof modes for mls gph h2o and co and the descent rates from the trace gases in the sh', 'o3 profiles in this study are constructed by merging the o3sondes up to the burst altitude and then using the mls profiles up to 60 km. the mls is an instrument on the aura spacecraft that uses microwave emission to measure atmospheric composition t and cloud properties. this shows that the mls mostly overestimates the o3 in the lower atmosphere at all stations. the merged profiles are generated only if an mls o3 profile is within a 2 2 latitudelongitude grid cell around each station and within 4 d of the o3sonde launch. o3 profiles are created by merging o3sonde profiles with o3 retrievals from the mls creating profiles from the surface to 60 km. the standard mls o3 product which is retrieved from spectra with frequency 240 ghz is used in this study. the difference in total column o3 calculated using profiles from the mls only versus profiles using o3sonde in the lower atmosphere and mls in the upper atmosphere. the merged profile is of high quality because in situ measurements of o3 are used in the lower atmosphere which accounts for an overestimation of o3 in this region by mls. on the other hand the mls o3 profiles are quite accurate in the stratosphere. monthly mean and standard deviations of total column o3 and partial column o3 for 2005-2017 for different atmospheric layers from merged o3sonde and mls for alert eureka summit and ny-ålesund. the mls o3 products have previously been used in o3 analyses e. o3 retrievals from the mls have been available continuously since 2004 over the arctic with overpasses over these sites every few days. figure 3 shows the difference of tco from the merged o3 profile versus tco from the mls only at all stations', 'taking this feature into account we can estimate the concentration of hcl in the young portion of the volcanic plume by applying a factor for the atmospheric dispersion that is the ratio of the mls hcl at 146. the estimated accuracy of hcl mixing ratios from mls is about 0. this work is based on satellite observations from the polar sun-synchronous eos aura mls envisat scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric chartography and eos aura omi. the omi bro retrieval also includes reference radiance spectrum selection and accurate wavelength calibration separately for each of the 60 detector rows of omi. investigation of mls data also reveals so2 from the pcc eruption up to 77 ppbv. oclo and bro slant columns were retrieved using differential optical absorption spectroscopy from sciamachy and omi nadir spectra respectively. hence the mls hcl values are not representative of the young plume of pcc. 3 level 2 mls hcl retrievals at 146. weekly number of mls hcl values above the background at 146. in order to consolidate the observations presented here we have conducted a series of tests to retrieve oclo from spectra acquired by omi and gome-2 and we also inspected the sciamachy and gome-2 bro column data. vertical column measurements of oclo by sciamachy and bro by omi after the eruption of the pcc volcano during the period of 5-9 june 2011. 1 shows mls hcl mixing ratios at 146. southern hemisphere mls measurements of hcl at 146. it should be stressed that the mls hcl mixing ratios underestimate the volcanic cloud concentrations because the plume vertical extent is smaller by about a factor of 3 than the vertical resolution of the mls hcl product', '', 'mls o3 has a high bias of 40 % at 100 hpa in the 6. zonally averaged time series of mls o3 at d 380 k over the course of these 3

djf and fma following el niño may be partially related to the isentropic transport of o3-rich air from the stratosphere. mls measurements and clams simulations as described above provide the enso-related differences in the horizontal distribution of o3. in this section we quantify the impact of enso anomalies on the mean o3 distribution based on mls satellite data clams simulations and shadoz o3sonde data. the o3 concentrations from clams simulations are about 50 ppbv lower than mls measurements at d 380 k in part because of the zero o3 boundary condition at the ground but they show similar patterns to mls o3. mls o3 data and the hilo o3sonde data from southern hemisphere additional o3sondes are used as references. seasonal o3 climatology derived from mls observations at d 380 k

locations to investigate the differences in re and precipitation associated with clean and polluted clouds. the aot daily data used in this study are generated from the aqua modis level 2 aerosol

precipitation as well as vertical velocity and divergence data from ncep analyses with a focus on south america. this altitude is the lowest upper tropospheric level where mls co retrievals are available; it is also close to the level of maximum convective detrainment. we separate ''clean'' clouds from ''polluted'' clouds in the following manner: for each mls measurement along the track at 215 hpa the ''clean'' cloud iwc is defined by the collocated co value < 120 ppbv; the ''polluted'' cloud iwc is defined by the collocated co value > 240 ppbv. results we first use the simultaneous measurements of co and iwc from aura mls to distinguish ''polluted'' clouds from ''clean'' clouds. the validity of this co as a proxy of aerosol is tested by correlations between the co and aqua modis aot data that are interpolated onto mls measurement locations. the retrieval methods and validation of mls co and iwc products are described by livesey et al. although the morphology of mls co has been validated to be realistic there is a known factor-of-2 high bias in the co value at 215 hpa. since mls iwc and co are simultaneous retrievals it is more convenient to use co to classify ''polluted'' and ''clean'' clouds rather than interpolated aerosol measurements from aqua modis. we find that enhanced co observed by mls is a good proxy of aerosols during the dry biomass burning season while it may be not appropriate to equate co and aerosol during the wet rainy season as the aerosol loading is much lower and co can still be quite high. the aot data are binned according to the collocated mls co at 215 hpa for both the dry biomass burning period and the wet rainy period. on the observational front analyses of isccp data by sherwood indicated that the effective radius of ice particles at the top of tropical cumulonimbus decreases in regions where the toms aerosol index is high. 5 of 6 aura mls cloud iwc measurements j. the aqua modis daily aggregation of ice cloud

including the one in the jpl06 recommendation and those derived from in situ atmospheric observations obtained during campaigns in the 1990 and 2003 arctic winters. 2 mls clo measurements which in the lower stratosphere have vertical resolution of ∼3 km. the mls launched as part of nasa's aura mission in july 2004 measures vertical profiles of a suite of trace gases in the middle atmosphere including clo. keq estimated from aura mls clo data measurements of clo in darkness when photolysis is negligible and remotely sensed air masses are expected to be in chemical and thermal equilibrium can be used to deduce keq. alternatively clox could be derived by estimating the total inorganic chlorine from mls measurements of n2o and assuming complete activation but this approach introduces errors from the assumed correlation between n2o and total chlorine as well as from the quality of the mls n2o data. three representative days during the 2008 arctic winter on which mls sampled a broad range of t conditions inside the vortex core are highlighted in fig. mls and slimcat data are interpolated to potential t surfaces and segregated by equivalent latitude using derived meteorological products based on nasa's global modeling and assimilation office goddard earth observing system versions 5. although clox could be inferred from mls measurements of daytime clo current uncertainties in the cloocl photolysis rate compromise the fidelity of such a calculation. the avallone and toohey keq typically overestimates mls clo at the lower ts but often produces the value closest to that observed whereas jpl06 typically underestimates mls clo but also often agrees with the data most closely. none of the keq expressions consistently provides the best match to mls clo data under all conditions. applying a more restrictive definition of “nighttime” for the mls clo measurements also has a negligible impact on the overall b estimate as does using a higher threshold t to define “warm” conditions. 2 nighttime mls clo at 520 k potential t for the southern and northern hemispheres. 05 ppbv uncertainty in the latitudeand altitude-dependent version 2 mls clo bias correction* *test run for the 2008 artic winter. 1 shows mls nighttime clo data 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 fig. on the basis of previous studies using aura mls and model simulations we define the peak activation periods to encompass january 20 through february 20 in the arctic and june 25 through september 1 in the antarctic during which total reactive chlorine typically constitutes more than 75% of total inorganic chlorine in the arctic lower stratospheric vortex core. keq uniformly overestimates mls clo. 3 shows time series over the 2008 arctic winter peak activation period of the differences between the clo calculated using the various keq relationships and that observed by mls for two particular t bins. for example on january 20 none of the expressions provide a particularly good match to the data although the clo amounts calculated from the avallone and toohey expression are at least within the mls uncertainty envelope. in contrast on january 25 the jpl06 keq leads to equilibrium clo abundances that initially follow the observed t variation well but depart substantially from the data at higher ts where the mls measurements fall between the curves based on the avallone and toohey and von hobe et al. mls radiance noise occasionally gives rise to negative clo mixing ratios; though unphysical negative values must be retained to avoid introducing biases into the calculations. averages of the daily b values weighted by their uncertainty arising from clo measurement noise are tabulated for each pressure surface in each winter in the arctic and antarctic along with the number of mls measurements going into the analysis in each case. the aura orbit is sun-synchronous ; thus mls observations at a given latitude on one segment of the orbit have essentially the same local solar time. 1 ppbv noise on individual mls clo measurements be propagated into lnðkeqþ space. individual mls measurements of nighttime clo inside the arctic vortex core at 46 hpa as a function of t for representative days in the 2008 arctic midwinter. 2 mls clo data at the retrieval levels primarily used here it is necessary to correct individual clo measurements by subtracting the estimated latitude-dependent value of the negative bias at each of the affected retrieval levels. the t dependence of the equilibrium constant inferred from the mls measurements is shown in fig. 6 o m and nominal slimcat clox amounts and clo abundances measured by mls over the peak chlorine activation period in the 2008 arctic winter. error bars are shown for the 46-hpa level for the arctic and antarctic winters of 2005 ; they reflect the estimated precision of the daily b retrievals calculated by propagating the precision of the mls clo measurements through the retrieval system. mls observes nonnegligible nighttime enhancement in clo poleward of 60-65° eql in all winters from late may through september in the antarctic and from december through february in the arctic. alternatively we have also run the retrieval system on the aggregate dataset comprised of all 37272 mls measurements of nighttime clo contributing to the daily retrievals. †based on retrieval of the aggregate dataset comprised of 37272 nighttime mls clo measurements at 46 and 68 hpa in the arctic and 32 and 46 hpa in the antarctic. 2 mls clo data are characterized by a bias uncertainty of 0. 5 further substantiates the quality and quantitative utility of mls clo data. bias and scaling errors in the mls clo data of 0. 05-ppbv uncertainty in the latitudeand altitude-dependent empirical bias correction for the version 2 mls clo measurements at the lowest retrieval levels leads to changes in the retrieved b value of ∼55 k. mls provides daily global coverage allowing the behavior of clo to be investigated over a broad range of ts throughout the polar vortices for multiple winters in both hemispheres. as expected from cloocl thermal decomposition mls nighttime clo abundances inside the winter polar vortices generally increase with increasing t. mls covers most of the polar vortex throughout multiple winters in both hemispheres leading to a vast quantity of nighttime clo measurements over a broader range of ts and more diverse conditions than are typically sampled by in situ datasets. unfortunately mls does not measure cloocl and no simultaneous colocated cloocl data exist. taking the root sum square of the changes in b arising from 1-σ estimated uncertainties in the mls clo data slimcat clox abundances mls clo bias correction ts sza threshold and included pressure levels we estimate the total uncertainty in our retrieved b value to be 135 k. thick black lines show the mls data averaged in 2-k t bins with error bars marking the clo measurement systematic uncertainty

inconsistencies between the modeled and mls iwc values described in this study are not yet clear. maps of iwc on january 2nd 2005 at 147 hpa from the eos mls measurements at footprint scale near 0130lst or 1330 lst daily averaged with 4 by 8 horizontal resolution and the ecmwf analyses averaging at 00 06 12 and 18z with 4 by 8. since there has yet to be a comprehensive validation campaign for mls iwc the systematic bias associated with this version of mls retrievals is not yet known. the eos mls onboard the aura satellite has five radiometers measuring microwave emissions from the earth's atmosphere to retrieve chemical composition h2o t and cloud ice. the estimated precision for the mls iwc is about 1. while there are still reservations associated with the mls iwc data they represent some measure of observation-based validation for this quantity which to date has been sorely lacking particularly on global scales and with some level of vertical discretization. the uars and eos mls experiments j. over the oceans the iwc distributions from both the mls and gcms exhibit a broad maximum over w. shown in figure 1a is an example of the mls iwc at 147 hpa for january 2nd 2005 with measurement tracks shown as small black dots and non-zero individual iwc measurements shown as colored dots. in this paper we examine the level of agreement between mls iwc measurements and iwc values from a number of state-of-the-art gcms as well as from the ecmwf analyses. for example comparing the january 2nd 2005 ecmwf and corresponding mls iwcs shows that the maxima in iwc are generally well captured by ecmwf over oceans as well as central africa with greater disagreement exhibited over s. america ecmwf iwc is smaller than the mls estimates in most cases. taking this into account and presuming that uppertropospheric iwc exhibits a similar maxima suggests that the mls may be biased low and thus the discrepancy between models and the mls values may be even larger in this region if this bias could be properly accounted for. although the mls iwc data has yet to be comprehensively validated the estimated precision for the iwc measurements is approximately 1. the eos mls on the aura satellite platform provides global observations of cloud iwc profiles along with contemporaneous profiles of t and h2o in the ut. maps of average iwc for january 2005 monthly mean at 147 hpa from the eos mls and the ecmwf analyses and single year multi-month simulation from csu-mmf and nasa fvmmf. in order to best illustrate the types and level of uncertainty associated with the above comparisons we discuss in more detail the mls and modeled iwc values over tropical s. taken together the findings suggest that mls estimates of iwc over s. note that the iwc from the mls measurements are not included in the ecmwf das and so a comparison of the two datasets is meaningful. in addition there is a discrepancy in the iwc exhibited in the eastern pacific and atlantic itczs with the mls values exhibiting considerably less iwc than ecmwf. this level was chosen since there is still considerable iwc at this level at least in the tropics and because there is greater confidence in the mls retrievals at pressures less than 200 hpa due to the reduced likelihood of liquid and mixed-phase clouds which adversely affect the retrieval\", \"appendix a figure a1 shows the seasonal mean h2o maps at 68 100 147 and 215 hpa pressure levels from aura mls observations merra merra2 and ecmwf reanalyses. we are also thankful for the support by the aura mls project gmao and ecmwf teams. because mls h2o measurements are not assimilated in the reanalysis systems evaluated here they serve as an independent data set for utls h2o. for mls h2o in the utls region these sampling biases may be as large as 30%. seasonal zonal mean and global mean h2o profiles from aura mls observations merra merra2 and ecmwf reanalyses. the mls observations show that at 215 and 147 hpa large h2o values are clustered in the climatological convective regions of western pacific south asia western central africa northern south america and central america in agreement with previous findings. figure 5 shows vertical velocity profiles for aura mls merra merra2 and ecmwf. mls averaging kernels are applied to the reanalyses h2o data. in the northern subtropics mls observations show that deep convection associated with summer monsoons during juneseptember clearly uplift large amounts of h2o to the ut followed by slower ascent into the ls between 100 hpa to ~10 hpa. ecmwf h2o is comparable to mls but its high-latitude regions are slightly drier. 1002 2015jd023752 key points: aura mls h2o measurements are used to evaluate utls h2o produced by three reanalyses significant wet biases in the upper troposphere are found in the analyses data utls h2o transport velocities are estimated from observations and compared with the reanalyses h2o is a significant greenhouse gas that affects both radiative and dynamic properties of the earth's atmosphere. the utls h2o measurements by the mls on the aura satellite provide important information that can be used to evaluate and guide the development of improvements in h2o fields produced by the reanalysis systems. to take into account possible sampling biases 3-hourly or 6-hourly h2o data from the reanalyses are sampled onto the mls measurement locations in both space and time and only the data seen by mls are averaged to construct daily or monthly means. the quasi-horizontal h2o transport from the tropics to higher latitudes at 100 hpa is evident in figure 4 as the “butterfly” features especially in the mls data. mls t is known to have a cold bias of up to ~2 k in the ut and thus is not used here. figure 1a shows 10 year mean h2o maps at four pressure levels from aura mls merra merra2 and ecmwf reanalyses. airs in particular gives information on vertical structure for atmospheric t and humidity. used aura mls h2o as tracer for vertical and horizontal transport in the ls and inferred interannual variations in the bdc upwelling speed during 2004 to 2012. note that the uncertainty in mls t does not affect the quality of mls h2o since the h2o retrieval is insensitive to t errors. the percentage difference is computed as the h2o from reanalyses minus the mls h2o and then divided by mls h2o. for global mean 68 hpa h2o the difference between all reanalyses and mls is within 4% which are insignificant compared to the mls measurement uncertainty here. using combined haloe and aura mls data lin et al. the vertical and horizontal transports of h2o in the 11469 utls are studied in section 4 where the effective transport velocities are estimated using both the mls data and the reanalysis products from gmao and ecmwf. annual mean t maps at 68 100 147 and 215 hpa pressure levels from aqua airs observations ; differences between reanalyses produced and airs observed annual mean ts. ten years h2o data from aura mls merra merra2 and ecmwf are used in computing the vertical velocities as described in the text. in addition to the mls h2o data we also use airs level 3 version 6 t product in our analysis. at 68 hpa in the ls mls observations show that the minimum h2o is located near the tropics and that the nh high latitudes are moister than southern hemisphere high latitudes which are consistent with the previous haloe observations reported by randel et al. we also note that aura mls is in a sun-synchronous orbit with equatorial crossings at ~1:45 p. the h2o measurements from aura mls are not assimilated into the ecmwf era-interim reanalysis. december-january-february mean h2o maps at 68 100 147 and 215 hpa pressure levels from aura mls observations merra merra2 and ecmwf reanalyses. as a unique utls observational data set the aura mls h2o data have been used extensively in atmospheric process analysis studies and model evaluations. the h2o data from mls and reanalyses are the same as used in figure 2a. humidity measurements from aura mls are not assimilated in merra. however mls ts have better quality at 100 hpa and thus will be used in the calculation of potential

generally comparable to those observed by mls although the spatial patterns differ. the 10% uncertainty from the velocity estimates based on the mls h2o time series. 11479 ten years of aura mls h2o measurements have been used to evaluate the performance of merra merra2 and ecmwf in reproducing the distribution of h2o and its transport from the ut into the ls. in the ls above the 380 k θ contour the difference between the reanalyses and mls h2o amounts is within the mls measurement uncertainty of 10% although the mls data seem to indicate a stronger transport of h2o into the extratropical stratosphere in the nh than in the sh during jja. the difference between h2o profiles with and without applying mls vertical averaging kernels varies in different locations and is ~5% for global mean values. the h2o data from mls and reanalyses are the same as used in figure 1a. here we use the aura mls data as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the utls h2o fields produced by the analysis and reanalysis systems. examining the tropics on the zonal mean plots we observe that both mls observations and the three reanalyses show that h2o maxima in the ut move from south of the equator during decemberjanuary-february to north of the equator during june-july-august which is consistent with the seasonal variation in deep convection. the uncertainty of the vertical velocities computed using aura mls data is estimated to be ~10%. the h2o anomalies in the ecmwf indicate a faster vertical transport velocity in the stratosphere than that inferred from mls although it has an interannual variability similar to the mls observations. figure 1b shows the percentage differences between annual mean h2o from reanalyses relative to mls measurements. in general all reanalyses overestimate the annual global mean h2o amount in the ut by up to ~150% compared to the mls observations which is significantly larger than the mls measurement uncertainty of ~20%. in this study we will use the 10 year mls observational record to evaluate the h2o amount and effective transport velocities and compare these to reanalyses produced by the nasa global modeling and assimilation office and ecmwf two major centers that have been producing widely used reanalysis data sets. using h2o tape recorder signal measured by the first generation mls instrument on board the uars niwano et al. first we compare the annual mean ut h2o from different data sets averaged over the 10 year mls observational period. the airs t has an uncertainty of ~1 k. annual mean h2o maps at 68 100 147 and 215 hpa pressure

observations for 2005-2015 for the source gas nitrous oxide. the 46 s annual zonal mean n2o in the gmi ctm follows mls n2o-640 but not n2o-190 at 46. the ratio of the standard deviation of the n2o fractional release to the mean value from gmi ctm and from geosccm averaged from 1990 to 2000 and from 2005 to 2015 at 46 n and 46 s. for the 1990s in contrast comparison of the simulated values with haloe ch4 and ground based columns reveals multiple issues in both hemispheres. in contrast the agreement with mls n2o during the aura period along with better agreement with observed hcl and hno3 columns indicates the realism of age variations obtained from 2005 onward. to emphasize multiyear variations we compare simulated annual averages with observed values from both mls n2o bands at 46 n at 46. 10 we look at mean age and observed and simulated ch4 changes over the period of the haloe observations. the mean of the gmi hno3 columns is 21 % lower than the mean of the observations. the differences between haloe and simulated ch4 for 1992-1998 are compared with differences for 1999-2005 by examining histograms of the percentage differences for each time period at 46. overall the differences between observed and simulated columns of hcl are correlated with the differences between observed and simulated hno3 strongly indicating transport as their cause and casting doubt on merra-2-driven gmi ctm lower-stratospheric mean ages in the 1990s. aura mls provides 3495 profiles daily between 81 s and 81 n; data are averaged in 2 latitude bins reducing precision uncertainty. we therefore consider whether the sparse data sets available from the early 1990s are sufficient to characterize multi-annual variations piecing together space-based observations from uars haloe and the multi-decadal ground-based column measurements of hno3 and hcl. the simulated mean ages for 2000-2005 are younger for 68-10 hpa compared with 1994-1999 consistent with the increase in gmi ch4. because the comparisons of observed and simulated hcl and hno3 columns are consistent with comparisons of observed and simulated fields of source gases continuation of these column data sets provides a robust means to evaluate the transport and mean age produced by reanalysis products in offline models such as the gmi ctm including their effects on stratospheric o3. the gmi ctm n2o follows both mls products at 31. the gmi ctm differences from the 1980-2015 mean for mean age n2o and ch4 at 72 hpa for 46 n and 46 s. the haloe mean ch4 decreases between 68 and 10 hpa whereas the gmi ch4 increases. the 46 n annual zonal mean n2o in the gmi ctm the mls n2o-640 the mls n2o-190 and the mean age at 46. apparent trends in constituents in both hemispheres seen in mls n2o and ground-based column measurements of hno3 and hcl are consistent with the changes in the lowerstratospheric residual circulation that caused an increase in mean age between 2007 and 2011 in the nh accompanied by smaller and opposing transport and mean age changes in the sh. 1 the global daily observations of the long-lived tracer n2o obtained from mls are ideal for determining whether circulation trends inferred from analyses and or from simulated age of air trends are consistent with observations. 2 haloe on uars measured profiles of o3 and other gases including ch4 using solar occultation from september 1991 until the end of the mission in late 2005. the strong relationship between variability in simulated lower-stratospheric mean age mls n2o and the ndacc hno3 columns demonstrates the value of these observations for evaluating the residual circulation and mixing in meteorological analyses. the gmi ctm and observed columns at lauder station in 1990-2014 for hcl and hno3. in each we compare the simulation with ground-based ftir column measurements of reservoir gases hcl and hno3 available from the early 1990s at some stations with haloe measurements of the source gas ch4 and with aura mls measurements of n2o. we look at observed and simulated ch4 changes over the period of the haloe observations by computing the difference between 1994-1999 and 2000-2005 mean profiles. the gmi ctm results show a large n2o increase between 1987 and 1995 in the northern midlatitudes followed by a decrease from 2002 to 2004 through 2010 and another increase from 2010 to 2013. the simulated n2o is

observations of tracers such as n2o obtained by aura mls since mid-2004 are ideal for evaluating the transport circulation in reanalysis data sets. factors other than nonuniform sampling complicate the relationship of haloe ch4 with circulation and mean age. we chose to emphasize 2005-2015 because aura mls obtained global data sets during this period. here we focus on midlatitude annual averages at two mls levels noting that the difference between the simulated and zonal mean mls n2o is less than 10 % for mls annual means greater than 150 ppbv. the gmi n2o tracks the observed n2o-640 at both levels and n2o-190 only at 31. the mean of the gmi hcl columns is within 3 % of the mean of observations. in gmi ctm the fractional release of n2o for fixed mean age varies substantially between 1990 and 2000 in both hemispheres. histograms of percentage differences between haloe and simulated ch4 at 46. comparison of the evolution of mean age n2o and ch4 in the gmi ctm with that in the geosccm

correlation coefficients between total o3 and tropospheric o3 offsets with the sondes are below 0. we compare two different tropospheric o3 products that use data from the aura satellite with in situ measurements made by o3sondes. conclusions results from two recently developed methods of determining tropospheric o3 from aura a residual based technique and a data assimilation were compared to o3 amounts from o3sonde profiles taken during ions‐06. stratospheric column o3 is calculated from the mapped and interpolated mls measurements and then is subtracted from interpolated omi total column o3. the omi instrument provides total o3 column measurements used for the ttor and asm calculations. we also compare the correlation of biases in omi total o3 column to 200 hpa tropospheric column biases to determine if error in the omi total column amount for a given day tends to dominate the corresponding tropospheric o3 discrepancy. the tropospheric o3 residual pioneered these techniques subtracting stratospheric aerosols and gases retrievals of stratospheric column o3 from toms total column o3 in order to retrieve tropospheric o3 values. the omi was designed to measure o3 and other

between this simulation and mls n2o o3 and clo profiles inside the arctic vortex during the winter of 2011. this study uses aura mls v4. good agreement between vortex gmi and mls o3 n2o and clo is also found in the very cold winter of 2011. comparisons of merra-driven simulations in the 1990s with data sets from the uars instruments such as the claes and the haloe reveal issues with the subtropical gradients in long-lived tracers and a poor representation of the effects of the quasi-biennial oscillation. in addition a second gmi simulation was integrated with the rates for heterogeneous reactions involving chlorine and bro set to zero for the months october to may. using mls o3 11842 measurements and the match method. to understand the variability caused by depletion in the multidecadal march arctic o3 record we calculate the march monthly mean column o3 depletion from the gmi simulations 2005-2015 averaged over 63-90°n geographic latitude as in wmo. the average december to march arctic o3 change is 77 du for both mls and gmi and 1 standard deviation of the gmi o3 error is 8 du about 10%. figure a1 shows excellent agreement in all 4 years between mls and gmi arctic cap stratospheric column o3 during the period of o3 depletion. figure a1 shows that the simulated column o3 changes closely track the mls o3 changes. we calculate the mls total column o3 by combining mls stratospheric column o3 with the gmi tropospheric o3 column. aura mls observations provide the first global daily profile data sets of o3 and a long-lived source gas. the range and mean of the heat fluxes from 1993 to 2004 are approximately the same as the range and mean of the aura period indicating no trend in wave driving during this 23 year period that might affect observed arctic o3 variability. the ability of the simulated column o3 and lower stratospheric n2o to closely track the mls observed changes during winter demonstrates that this simulation is well suited for the calculation of heterogeneous chemical loss and dynamical contributions to arctic o3. we demonstrate the fidelity of the gmi simulation with full chemistry by comparing it with aura mls o3 and n2o observations. the comparisons to mls n2o in figure a1 verify that before the final warming the simulation produces realistic transport in the arctic lower stratosphere whether the vortex is strong or weak. figure a1 shows that the seasonal change in gmi n2o tracks closely with observed changes throughout the winter indicating a good representation of vortex isolation and descent. we calculate mls o3 columns using levels 268-0. figure 7 shows the time series of observed arctic march o3 from toms and omi instruments from 1979 to 2015. mls and gmi stratospheric o3 columns are calculated using the same pressure range 268-0. the quantitative relationship identified between cold days and o3 depletion during the aura period made it possible to estimate arctic spring o3 loss from 1993 to 2004 using merra temperatures. gmi stratospheric column o3 also has very good agreement with mls through the end of march. using aura mls o3 data from 2004 to 2011 calculated losses ranging from 22 to 116 du. we used realistic simulations from the gmi ctm with and without heterogeneous halogen chemistry to quantify the heterogeneous chemical loss and the dynamical contributions to march arctic o3 for the winters 2005-2015\", \"another factor that can cause the lower iwc is mls sensitivity limitation. in this study we evaluate the consistency of uppertropospheric iwc measurements from another pair of a-train sensors: caliop 532-nm backscatter and mls 240and 640-ghz radiances. 4 there is good agreement between caliop and cloudsat r04 iwc pdfs at 12 and 15 km in the overlapped sensitivity ranges. two cloudsat iwc retrievals are included: one from the standard iwc product in the r04 release and the other from the retrieval assuming the mh97 size distribution. in the standard mls cloud ice product the 240-ghz tcir is used for the iwc retrieval while the tcir at other frequencies are also computed and archived as diagnostic products. consider the microwave radiances in form of tb 5 t0 where t0 is the ambient air t t0 is the gaseous optical depth along mls los and dtcir is the cloud-induced optical depth. to match the caliop and mls measurement volumes we integrate the caliop data along the mls los to obtain a horizontally integrated iwc and integrated 532-nm backscatter g532 mathematically: ð' 2' ð fov los iwc ds dz ð' 2' ð fov losb532 ds dz where fov is the mls field of view at tangent height z approximately gaussian with a frequency-dependent beamwidth. mls cloud signals can become saturated in a very large iwc case. normalized pdfs of cepex caliop and cloudsat iwc at 12 and 15 km for july 2006 in a tropical band 2. as a result it reports the large iwc for a smaller value causing a low bias in the mls retrieval as iwc increases which is evident in the mls-cloudsat probability density function comparison. thus we should focus more on the comparison at small iwc values where clouds are relatively thin and above the cloudsat detector noise the cloudsat cloud ice pdf agrees with caliop v3. aura mls launched in july 2004 has seven radiometers with horizontal and vertical polarizations at frequencies near 118 190 240 640 ghz and 2. all these cross-satellite evaluations support the speculation that the lower bias in mls iwc which increases with height was because of the mh97 size distribution assumption. the cloudsat iwc noise produces a white pdf below its detection limit corresponding to approximately 5 mg m23 at 12 km and approximately 30 mg m23 at 15 km respectively. cloudsat iwc retrievals from r04 and from the mh97 size distribution are included for comparisons. this agreement improves fidelity of the scattering-based caliop and emissionbased mls iwc retrievals as a result of the consistent microphysics in explaining the observed tcir-g532 correlation. at approximately 15 km within 5% of their variability the typical values of tb0 in the tropics are around 40 and around 135 k for mls 240and 640-ghz radiances respectively and t0 ; 200 k is used for the ambient clear-sky air t near the tropopause. without the caliop data it is difficult to determine mls tcir sensitivity to iwc values because of large measurement error in mls tcir. iwc retrievals we compare them with cloudsat data and statistics of in situ measurements in terms of normalized probability density function. the cloudsat r04 iwc statistics agree well with the cepex statistics over a broad range of iwc. since then aura mls and caliop footprints are brought within 610 km in the cross-track direction. at high ht mls radiances can penetrate through the atmosphere limb to measure iwc. found that mls iwc retrieval is lower by as large as a factor of 5 at pressures 200 hpa. the estimated caliop and cloudsat iwc precisions are 0. mls can detect ice clouds if the cloud top reaches mls limb tangent heights ht but the sign of the cloud-induced radiance tcir the difference between the observed radiance and modeled clearsky radiance after gas species retrievals are completed is a function of ht and cloud iwc or ice water path in the limb line of sight. in the case where iwc and ice particle sizes are small scattering can be neglected at the mls frequencies which leads to the linear proportionality of tcir to iwc. mls and caliop cloud ice measurements in the upper troposphere: a constraint from microwave on cloud microphysics this study examines the consistency and microphysics assumptions among satellite iwc retrievals in the upper troposphere with collocated a-train radiances from mls and lidar backscatters from cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarization. since mls tcir is directly proportional to iwc and independent of the shape of particle size distribution for small iwc values the resulting iwc-b532 relation provides additional constraint on the caliop cloud ice retrieval. here ds is mls pathlength in kilometers iwc is in milligrams per cubic meter wavelength l is in centimeters and are real and imaginary part of ice dielectric constant. from the observed relationships between mls cloudinduced radiance tcir and the caliop backscatter integrated g532 along the mls line of sight an empirical linear relation between cloud ice and the lidar backscatter is found: iwc b532 5 0. for the cases in which iwc values are small the cloud ice retrievals are constrained by both mls 240and 640ghz radiances and caliop 532-nm backscatter b532. similarly the cloudsat iwc noise is estimated from the reflectivity measurements ze using the calculated ze-iwc relation. the 12 km is a critical altitude for cloudsat iwc validation against in situ measurements\", '', \"mls provides atmospheric profiles of t and composition via passive measurement of microwave thermal emission from the limb of the earth's atmosphere. aura flies in formation with calipso in the atrain satellite constellation and caliop and mls measurement tracks are closely aligned. mls h2o profiles presented in this study are interpolated to the caliop psc grid using a weighted average of the two nearest mls profiles. minimum values of gas phase hno3 were observed by aura mls in the second half of january at the same time than caliop confirmed the existence of synoptic-scale ice clouds. h2o and hno3 were measured using the mls aboard the aura satellite. evidence of this can be seen in the odin smr and aura mls satellite measurements of hno3 shown in fig. investigated this hypothesis and offered ice nucleation on nat particles as a possible explanation for the low hno3 observations by the sub-millimetre radiometer aboard the odin satellite and aura mls during the same winter. the resolution of mls is too coarse to capture the local reduction in h2o at this time. for s1 hno3 values were taken from mls averaged

instruments; for example the haloe the stratospheric aerosol and gas experiment and the mls. the mls v4 o3 profiles used in this study are filtered by the quality control criteria. the mls o3 profiles have lower standard deviation in larger than the global mls deviation but less than that in lhasa tengchong and naqu the middle stratosphere while the o3sonde profiles have lower standard deviation in which are located in the east of the south asian high center. to compare the two o3 datasets at the same pressure the o3sonde profiles are interpolated into 16 layers of the mls o3 between 10 and 200

have lower standard deviation in the utls region. the data quality of the mls level 2 version 4 o3 products is greatly improved compared to the mls version 3 o3 products for the utls region. the mean value of the mls o3 is about 0. the mls is an instrument onboard the earth observing system's aura satellite which was launched by nasa of the united states in july 2004. mls v4 o3 offers benefits relative to mls v3 o3 toms retrieved value is lower than ground-based measurements by comparing with o3sonde data over the tibetan plateau. nevertheless in the lower stratosphere the relative difference between mls o3 and o3sonde over shiquan river in the central region of the south asian high is less than that over lhasa tengchong and naqu which are located in the east of the south asian high center. however the relative deviation of the mls o3 over the tibetan plateau is larger in this study. the vertical resolution of the mls o3 profile is much lower than that of the o3sonde profile. this study will provide a further region of the south asian high providing an opportunity to validate mls o3 version 4. 9840 previous studies have shown that the global average difference between mls o3 and o3sonde data is less than 8% in most parts of the stratosphere. the o3 concentration derived from the mls data is 0. the possible reasons are the small mean deviation of the two datasets and the large standard deviation of the mls o3 in the utls region\", 'also during the arctic winter 2010 2011 hno3 was permanently removed from the stratosphere thus leading to a strong denitrification of the arctic stratosphere as has been shown in previous studies using observations from aura mls odin smr and envisat mipas. 5 we simulated the arctic winters 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 with the chemistry-climate model emac and compared the results to satellite observations from envisat mipas and aura mls. the aura mls instrument is an advanced successor to the mls instrument on the uars. however contrary to the 2009 2010 winter here the emac hno3 mixing ratios are slightly higher compared to aura mls. similar differences in hno3 as discussed above are found when comparing the time series derived from emac with the one derived from aura mls. 1 comparison to envisat mipas and aura mls observations 1 shows the gas-phase distribution of hno3 as simulated with emac for selected dates between 21 december 2009 and 29 january 2010 at 34 hpa. strong re-nitrification is visible in the envisat mipas and aura mls observations in midto late january but is not as strongly simulated with emac. figure 3 shows the temporal evolution of t and hno3 from emac envisat mipas and aura mls for the arctic winter 2009 2010 at high latitudes as a function of pressure. another prominent difference between the emac simulation and the observations by envisat mipas and aura mls is found with the onset of hno3 gas-phase removal by pscs and throughout the psc season. this difference between emac and the satellite observations of envisat mipas and aura mls in hno3 throughout the psc season arises because the simulated pscs in emac differ from those observed by envisat mipas. emac envisat mipas aura mls. the patterns of the temporal evolution of hno3 derived from envisat mipas and aura mls are generally similar; however envisat mipas provides slightly higher hno3 abundances than aura mls. the envisat mipas and aura mls measurements on 8 january 2011 show an elongated area with low hno3 stretching near the pole from north-east to south-west. here we use aura mls version v4. considering hno3 time series at 50 hpa we found that differences in hno3 between emac and the observations from aura mls were generally less than 10-20 %. the minor warmings are simulated by emac with the correct timing but with a slightly different strength from that observed by envisat mipas and aura mls as can be seen from the t distribution shown in fig. 3 the mls on the earth observing system aura satellite was launched in july 2004. the aura mls data set is publicly available from https: disc. further the re-nitrification at 70 hpa which is clearly seen in envisat mipas and aura mls is not as clearly visible in the emac simulation thus indicating an underestimation of re-nitrification in emac. otherwise the early-winter hno3 distribution of emac compares well to envisat mipas and aura mls concerning structure and temporal development. emac hno3 mixing ratios are generally 1-2 ppbv or up to 20 % lower than the ones observed by aura mls during the psc season. as pscs form gas-phase hno3 is removed but this removal occurs earlier and more strongly in emac albeit restricted to 100 to 50 hpa while the strong removal of hno3 seen in the envisat mipas and aura mls measurements from midjanuary onwards extends over the area from 100 to 20 hpa. the absolute and relative differences between the emac and aura mls time series were calculated. a detailed assessment of the quality and reliability of the aura mls v2. otherwise the structure of the earlywinter hno3 distribution of emac is generally in agreement with envisat mipas and aura mls. for this winter pscs are also not simulated as high up as measured and re-nitrification is underestimated while denitrification occurs earlier and more strongly in emac than observed by envisat mipas and aura mls. 2 comparison to envisat mipas and aura mls observations as for the arctic winter 2009 2010 we start with a comparison of daily maps of hno3. a prominent difference between the hno3 distribution simulated by emac and the hno3 distributions measured by envisat mipas and aura mls is that emac exhibits a slightly smaller background distribution and that the maximum in hno3 is located at slightly higher pressure levels. ms provided the aura mls data and contributed to the discussion and interpretation of the results derived in this study. though the emac simulation and the satellite observations from envisat mipas and aura mls show removal of gasphase hno3 in accordance with the time and pressure levels where ts below 195 k are found there are nevertheless obvious differences between model simulations and satellite observations. comparison of the mipas hno3 data product with satellite measurements from odin smr adeos ilas-ii scisat ace-fts and the envisat mipas esa product showed good agreement and differences were generally within 0. figure 9 shows the temporal evolution of t and hno3 from emac envisat mipas and aura mls for the arctic winter 2010 2011 at high latitudes as a function of pressure. for example only qualitative comparisons of clo o3 and hno3 to aura mls measurements were performed mainly based on multi-year averages. the same holds when emac simulations are compared to aura mls observations. here measurements from both satellites envisat mipas and aura mls are considered. warm ts propagate further down into the stratosphere than observed by envisat mipas and aura mls. this difference is also found when emac simulations are compared to calipso observations where pscs are found up to 28 km ; thus hno3 in our emac simulation is not removed from the gas phase as high up as seen in the envisat mipas and aura mls observations. as for the arctic winter 2009 2010 the simulated ts from emac nudged toward ecmwf era-interim compare well with the ts measured by envisat mipas and aura mls. time series of hno3 from emac and aura mls for the arctic winter 2010 2011. in the following the time series of hno3 for the arctic winter 2009 2010 derived from the emac simulation is compared with the one derived from the aura mls observations. the ts from emac nudged toward ecmwf era-interim are in good agreement with the ts measured by envisat mipas and aura mls. time series of hno3 from emac and aura mls for the arctic winter 2009 2010. the model simulations for the arctic winters 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 compare well with measurements from envisat mipas and aura mls showing that emac is capable of giving a realistic representation of the arctic winter stratosphere in terms of psc formation and the hno3 and 2. in the envisat mipas and aura mls observations only the minimum over russia is observed', 'in addition results will be compared to o3 observations from the mls instrument onboard the aura satellite version 3 data. nonetheless mls o3 shows enhanced gradients coinciding with the pv value of the transport barrier over several days providing further confidence in the pv-based anticyclone transport barrier. same but for mls o3 data sampled during the period 4-8 july 2011 with the mls data binned into 3 6 latitude longitude bins. the vertical resolution of mls o3 is about 3 km. lower o3 mixing ratios in the model compared to mls are likely related to the broad satellite averaging kernel and the zero mixing ratio boundary condition at the surface in the model. o3 from mls and clams vs. to create a similar map from o3 measurements we bin o3 observations from mls between 4 and 8 july 2011 in order to obtain sufficiently dense observations. mls profiles are originally on pressure levels and were interpolated to potential t surfaces for the purpose of this study. motivated by studies of the polar vortex where the transport barrier is characterized by particularly steep gradients of conserved tracers we map mls and clams o3 vs. figure 3 shows that despite the offset between clams and mls o3 mentioned above there is agreement in the main structure with low o3 in the core of the anticyclone and higher mixing ratios towards higher pv. figure 14 compares the gradient of mls observed o3 in the monsoon region to the pv-based transport barrier similarly to fig. for mls co a standard tropospheric tracer for asian monsoon studies the vertical resolution is coarser and therefore we focus on o3 for this study', 'the gozcards1112 dataset for hcl includes zonal average monthly mean time series of

decrease the values over mls retrievals dictates a lower limit on the iwc values central africa and increase them slightly over the parts of that can be obtained; roughly 1. this of course tends to slightly enhance the disagreement in magnitude found between the sampled ecmwf and the mls iwc values discussed above. the mls data are not assimilated in the ecmwf das and thus the mls iwc retrievals can be considered an independent validation dataset. at present there are still considerable uncertainties and limitations regarding the mls iwc retrievals most notably coarse vertical resolution the limitation in scope to the upper troposphere and as yet a lack of adequate independent validation. maps of annual average iwc for period of august 2005 july 2005 mean at 147 hpa from the eos mls the

difference between the sampled filtered ecmwf data and the mls retrievals shows that ecmwf iwc values are less than mls values by about 30 50% relative to mls over nearly all the tropical landmasses as well as over much of the south pacific convergence zone. spatially these changes in iwc bear some similarity to the biases between mls estimates and the sampled ecmwf analyzed values. the eos mls on the aura satellite platform provides global observations of cloud iwc profiles. in general the sampled ecmwf iwc values are smaller than the mls estimates. the results of the comparison between the mls and sampled ecmwf analyzed iwc show that for the annual mean the overall geographical distribution agrees quite well. a detailed description and validation of the mls iwc retrieval is given by wu

less relative to the initial time and thus the day-10 forecast differences with mls iwc are consistent with the discussion above. we have examined and compared a number of daily mls and sampled ecmwf iwc maps and found that the two data sets are in relatively good agreement particularly in terms of geographical distribution over the oceans. over the oceans the ecmwf analyses are larger than mls values by about 10% but over tropical landmass and maritime continent the ecmwf analyses are smaller than the mls iwc by up to 50%. it is important to note that the mls iwc data has yet to be

mls sensitivity cutoff is considered small values of ecmwf iwc are set to zero and thus the mean values are slightly reduced as is evident when comparing figure 2c and the filtered data in figure 2e. the ecmwf iwc is sampled along mls orbit tracks and assigned zero values when it is less than the lower sensitivity limit of the mls instrument. summary and discussion iwc estimates from the mls for the period august 2004 to july 2005 are compared to both ecmwf analyses and forecasts\"]\r\n",
