List of things still to work on
* Finding dois in the references when they are slightly deformed (ie: missing a
character in the middle or with extra spaces. Honestly, finding a better
pdf conversion tool than cermine might be the easiest way to go about this.)
* When extract free text citations (no doi & no shortname but 'GES DISC' or GES
DISC website)
    * clean up the splitting of the references
    * map the free text to a dataset
* Explicit datasets that are mentioned by a different short name (ie: Merra M2_tag_v...)
