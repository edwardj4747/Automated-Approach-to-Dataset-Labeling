These python files were used to create some of the data files in the `data/json` 
directory. Many of them reference the indidual dataset meta-data and loop through 
the metadata for each dataset, so if you want code that does that, feel free to grab one of these and modify 
it to meet your needs.

I tried to make the file names descriptive, but all of the files created 
using these scripts are in the `data/json` folder, so if you want to see 
what the output is, you can check the corresponding file. Most of these 
files, as the directory name would imply, were only run once, as the 
outputted file was the important part.
