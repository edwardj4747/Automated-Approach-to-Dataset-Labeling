I played around with creating csv files that could be uploaded to an AWS S3 Bucket and then loaded into an
AWS Neptune Graph Database. While these files do include all the features or detailed relationships, it should show
the basic form of csv files for both vertices and edges that can be included into an Neptune database.

I also included the file `create_graph_data.py` which I used to create the sample files just as a template if needed.
